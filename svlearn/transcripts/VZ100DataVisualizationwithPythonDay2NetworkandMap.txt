 Let's go and do... Let's start with, well, for good reason, networks. Let's do networks. networks will require and this is something that i want you to do guys because most people don't know how to do visualization so please humor me and type as i go on don't type the text type the cells as i go on i will make it a bit bigger input the usual stuff but then also type in these two things you will need these two network x and pi base now remember there are two visualization libraries py vis and py v i s and p y v i z right the the one that ends with s is for network visualization the one that ends with z is basically uh much more robust it's about all sorts of visualizations once you are there, run this. Run these codes. I got an error saying could not find a version that satisfies the requirement network X conversions. They don't want you to visualize the gods don't want you to visualize. Let's take it offline. During this week, we'll sit and fix it. We'll figure it out. Little bits of issue. Which version of the operating system do you use? Is it the latest version of Mac? No, it is not. It is not. Maybe that's the reason. It is one version behind. So, yeah, I will get that fixed in then. Yeah. One of the inevitable consequences of people entering data science has been that they eventually end up buying a high-powered laptop all of them yeah so yeah so k2 so uh and people here are such an instructor they all have high-powered servers running in their home for data science so since you're going to eventually buy a high-powered laptop anyway, go get that. Apple has this nice M1 Pro Max. Laptops with the M1 Pro Max. People are raving about it. Really raving. Okay, definitely. Yeah, it has a new chip and it's very, very small. It has a neural engine. It has a neural engine. That's right. it's very very small it has a neural engine that's right so that laptop uh wenty has specific optimizations for deep neural networks and data science oh i didn't know that okay so you'll love it perfect thank you equivalent for this and yeah i have the alien bear i use the alien bear this is pretty good it's heavy though see this is the only laptop that needs two power supplies right is this heavy and is big and bulky this is the top end alien bear area what is it area 51 laptops you can go for it but i would suggest yeah the other one which I like is Lambda Labs. I have another one which I'm tending to like more. Lambda Labs. Okay, let me show you the website. If you tend to be PC heavy, oh, by the way, this is the PyWiz I'm starting with. This. A lot of people rave about this. I have their laptops, I don't have their desktop. So they make laptops dedicated to data science or machine learning. So you see this deep learning laptop here on my screen. And if you click on that, you can sort of build your own depending on your budget. But the good thing is you will know that it is meant for machine learning so you won't get surprises the best part is if you take the ubuntu version they will actually install all the machine learning like so you don't have to do any of the most of the creep installs etc you don't have to worry about it it's all there right so out of the box you get something that works without doing anything now what is the price that you pay because these things run hot do you notice that the resolution is not 4k it's a relatively low resolution 1920 by 30 why they're keeping the partly the heat and partly they're keeping the graphic card for machine learning not wasting it on fancy displays. You can always get second monitors anyway. Yeah, everybody has second monitors, high resolution monitors. So obviously this sort of crowd tends to go with this. And then there is obviously, so Lambda Labs, I would say if I have to buy today, I would go with instead of Alienware. And then there is of course the apple i'm about to order actually this one for myself because i don't have it this map go with mac notebook pros go with this do you see that it says 16 core neural engine? I don't know. Yeah. So these things are very sweet. And pretty much Silicon Valley here has 10. Co. You look at the Silicon Valley is moved to this. And what I and what happens is, it is over 3600. But I think it is well made these machines have a premium they command and now you can upgrade based on whether you want to the only thing in my view that is worth upgrading is the memory because in any kind of mathematical work you do the more the memory you have, the better. Other than that, I wouldn't. Hard disk you can always attach externally and it will be less expensive. Right, right. Sounds good. Thank you. Okay. So let's get back to- One question, Mr. Ansari. With an external server, how do you use that for machine workloads and work on a laptop to connect to that and all that oh you just have to be on the network that's it that is it so you run the jupiter headless jupiter on your server okay and from here you connect to it that's cool oh okay yeah that's it and then some people run like if you want to really go the royal road install something called the jupiter hub let me show you what that is server or full-blown server installations something called jupiter hub okay right this is like running a server and lots of people connecting to it with their own jupiter you know jupiter networks by the way uh we have a jyterHub set up here at SupportLinux. But because of the pandemic, nobody is here. I mean, very few people are here. So I don't want to create an asymmetry between people who are here and not here. Now I am setting up a VPN access for students. Eventually I'll get there. Then you all can access this service from outside nice but for now uh i'm not sharing okay cool thank you that helps you see those machines in the back right that's what they have all right so now we come to this part so guys have you all run it is there anybody else who's having problem with this? If you have succeeded, now we are going to run some basic code. So first of all, do two imports. These two imports. The rest of it is cosmetics that you remember from before. This one. And these are the two imports that I want. Please take this to import this part. The rest of it is aesthetic elements. I just copy paste perhaps into the notebook. Like, is it the fact that we use it? I did this one, but the next one's okay but I want you to type this on your own so you develop some muscle memory type these two lines of code Thank you. So, should we like perform format? No, no, that part I've given in the slide. Just pick it up. It's there. From matplotlib import rc, that paragraph down here. You just have to write the two import statements because I want you to become familiar with it, with those two. So now we'll draw some very basic let's let's make some baby steps the simplest network you can think of is like a star network you know it has one center and every other node is connected to the one half percent node right so how would you do that let me talk about these two libraries network xX and PyGas. See, NetworkX is a very powerful Python network algorithms library. algorithms in this work there's a whole field called network science in network science people have and there is a lovely book which i refer to at the end of my notebook let me actually open that book because that book is really lovely where is that book called the network science this book he has made this entire book into a website. This book is also available in Amazon as a physical book. I have the physical book. The physical book looks like this. Albert, yes. So anyway, it doesn't let you go smaller. This is the title of this is how the cover of the book looks. But you can start reading the book online, you can download the slides, you can do all the datasets, I would highly encourage you to do that. This book is lovely. So you can read a lot about this field of network science, but suffice this to say, I'll just introduce it and show how the subject is exploding. Everything is a network, electricity grids are networks, our brains are networks of neurons, internet of course is a network, social networks, we all know, professional networks, Facebook, LinkedIn, networks are everywhere. Right. You publish a paper and you refer to five other authors who publish papers. So you have a network of references and so on and so forth. So networks are everywhere and networks are not just a jumble of nodes connected to each other. Their mathematical properties have been better understood. And if you look at this, how popular or how often the work network scientists refer to, you can see that it has exponentially been increasing right if you search for these two authors erdos rengi who wrote a model the first network theory that was created was in 1959 the science behind it followed by another great guy in the school just look at how often they are being referred to people have just sort of discovered them and you can you can do the Google trends more recently. So network science has emerged in its own. And people are creating, if you look at some of the most prestigious magazines, they are bringing up this beautiful, like for example, this is the brain, 3D brain wiring of a mouse. People have gone and actually found the networking topology of the neurons in a mouse's brain. It's everywhere. The societal impact is huge. Time and again, our DNAs are impacting other, you know, one gene affects another gene, this, that. There's even terrorism to fight terrorism. There's a network. Everything is a network. There is more to it. I'll let you guys have fun with this. There's a variety of networks that you can have, lots and lots of types of networks. But today, because this is not a course on network science, but a course on visualization. By the way, I do offer a course in network science, with a four-week course. That's for later. This is visualization we'll just learn the visuals so let's start with the basics very basics and of course here we'll limit ourselves to the very very basics yes i covered before barabasi who made the breakthrough of the scale-free networks that giant complex networks like the internet, they have a scale-free or fractal structure. I see, right, you've covered that. Yes, yeah, and this is a book written by him. So let's create a simple network, I'll graph this. So network X is the library that helps you build with networking, networks and their manipulation. So let us create a network with a star of 100 nodes surrounding a hub. Let's do that. So I want you guys to type in this code and come to our visualization. And let me know. I'll give you guys a minute. Let's see if you achieve that. Guys, I hope you're not getting too tired. i'll give you guys a minute and let's see if you you achieve that guys i hope you're not getting too tired is it fun so far yes yes And remember guys, everything that I'm teaching just as a last week, all these notebooks will be online. In fact, many things that we didn't get the time to teach, we'll put those Jupyter notebooks also there for visualization. So you will have a lot of homework to read through all of this so that you're maximally benefit from this workshop please do review those later on and again i'll be giving extra sessions throughout the week in the evening there'll be help sessions occasionally i'll step in and explain something uh so if you need it is beneficial if you attend it if you you get stuck somewhere, something is not working, that's the time to come for clinic office. Where do you do this? Online? Yeah, yeah. The same course, the same Zoom link. Every evening at 8pm pacific time, we are there. Whether you are there or not, always usually uh most schools complain that the student teacher ratio is bad in support vectors we have literally four or five tas and one student shows up or two students show up so you get a very very healthy teacher student ratio here so that s is a upper thing no it's small star graph python most functions are start with small digits. I'm getting an error. I'm still looking at where I have a typo or something. It says tuple index out of range. Oh in this particular graph? Maybe I'm typing something wrong. I'm just looking into this thing. Let's just talk. Is anyone else having a problem? Kashish asked, could you please roll up to the import statement for the next? Alright guys, how many of you have not reached this graph? This network visualization? Can I assume we all have and move forward? What's your error? Can I assume we all have and move forward? What's your error? I could add on the next draw star. Yeah the star equals nx dot nx dot star graph of n that is that is fine but when i say next dot draw it gives me some error saying tuple index out of range oh why the difference let me go oh okay on this machine i have not installed iris with me because okay i need to run it from the thing let me start the remote state index is incorrect it says random state index is incorrect random state index is incorrect oh I don't know what that is oh you didn't do the full important the random oh thank god i'm also getting the same message it's very interesting pupil index pi random state this is very true i didn't realize that network x breaks on some machines i'm on windows and it breaks are you also on windows yes i'm on windows it's running fine huh so i did the import right here you don't have import no i do have okay this one let me do that let's see let's see what happens after all those interesting interesting on windows this does seem to be rather broken forgive me guys and so uh and next the draw on some machines is not working so hold on guys i'll find a fix for it and i'll come back okay okay thank you so when you get the graph it looks pretty ugly let's beautify the graph a little bit and but before we beautify the graph let's see if you look at the graph it's a static image isn't it there's no interactivity to it well in my case i don't even see it now image isn't it there's no interactivity to it well in my case i don't even see it now but there is no no beauty to it we'll make it interactive so what we will use is we will use the other library which is the five bits it is based on the viz js library in javascript for network visualization this library in my view right it's it's a hit and miss sometimes you can visualize networks with it and you feel good you get interactivity other times you don't it's not as mature as the network excellent but for what it is we will do that and i hope i will run it and i hope i don't get it let's see so when you run now i want you to write this these two lines are the same but i want you to use five ways to visualize it now the way the pi base works is that it saves your data into a file the entire graph becomes a html file so you can visit that html file when you run, you can visit it and it will call it will be called star. Yes, star network. Do you see this is the star network. And this is interactive, you can move this around. I can see I'm creating disturbances, I'm picking a node and moving it around. That's it. It looks like the COVID virus certainly. With all those things. Grab the center and shake it around, it looks like a funky little creature. Yeah, it looks like that, right? So anyway, you get interactivity which here is somewhat silly but if you run this code on your machine it should open a browser automatically with that visualization so i will let you all type it in uh yes small question. Is network X built on D3? No. In fact, network X creates only static images, not D3. This one, net, the is based on Viz.js, which is a JavaScript library in its own right for network visualizations. Okay. uh by wiz is based on wiz js which is a javascript library in its own right for network visualizations okay so it's sort of a hit and miss guys and so uh all of you uh have you managed to write this four five lines of code extra lines of code four lines extra this one works it all works right this one works okay nice and you see the graph you you basically see your visualization yeah to go with it like this yes so one of the things i would suggest is these visualizations do you notice that i've enabled all the controls button controls you can take the border with if you increase the border do you notice that these nodes now look thick bordered border width selected right so suppose i select a border this so things like that you can change the color for example you can say what is that a color is opacity initial final i don't know how to control this okay whatever it is worth let's say apply you can play with a lot of things here click on the rectangle it brings up a color wheel yeah oh yes and by the way there is a layout you can play with the layout if you play with the layout, suppose you make the hierarchic, see what happens when you make it hierarchical. You made it hierarchical, and what is it? Because there is one parent node, the hub, and all of them begin to look like children. Do you see this, guys, on my screen? It's a little hard to see, but I'll zoom in a little bit. You see this, right? Looks like a marching army. Yes, marching army. Yeah, these days it's a little scary to talk about armies, what with all the mischief out there in Ukraine and other countries. Yeah, Russia. So, okay. Then, if you got here, then a similar graph, I just changed one line. Now what we will do is, let me show you the output. This is another graph topology in which every node is connected to every other node. Do you see this? I have, I deliberately created 10, I believe, 10 or 20, 20 nodes and all the nodes, it's called a complete graph. A complete graph is, and a synonym for it is a fully connected graph. A fully connected graph, a complete graph is one in which everything is connected to everything else. And you can verify from this in which everything is connected to everything else. And you can verify from this visualization that everything is connected to everything else. Now, all we have to do is, in the previous code, you can just change it. This code that you wrote here, the previous code, you can just change the word from stargraph to complete graph, and the visualization will change. But let's do a little bit better. Let's try to make it more aesthetically pleasing from a network X perspective because network X looks rather boring. So what we'll do is we'll improve upon it. And let's look at the code. We are setting the size of the image. By now, this looks familiar, guys, a picture size, a figure size. Then I'm going to take a complete of 20 nodes once we do now you realize that if everything is connected to everything a circular layout or laying them out in a circular format would be probably a good idea so it is called the layout how do you lay them called the layout how do you lay them to look visually and that typically in this world of network visualization people often call it the positioning even though the word layout is common in network x language they call it pos the positioning or something so you create a positioning for these points so remember this is just data So you create a positioning for these points. So remember, this is just data. Network is a data structure. It's a graph. It's an abstract thing made up of edges and nodes. Now you're saying lay those edges and nodes out in saying nx.draw we are going to explicitly say first draw the nodes why do you notice that i painted the nodes salmon colored i increased its size and made it a little bit alpha just prettified the nodes a little bit actually indian red so we can do that you can say first draw only the nodes so use the nodes for this data this graph this layout and i'm giving the node size 200 it's very much like s in matplotlib s is equal to 100 or 200 that's what it does alpha is the transparency we are familiar with node color again we know what that is so this will draw only the nodes in indian red color which you see here then i say go draw the edges here exactly the same code more or less except that we are talking about network x edges draw edges right then you get this 0.35 blah blah blah and color black i chose to give it a black you can give it any other and then you can give it a type the rest of it is from your map right give it a nice title set a title and so guys type it in and see if you can reproduce this graph by the way it need not have been the complete complete it could be any graph right, but the code it helps to paint or draw the notes give aesthetics to the notes and then give us to that it separately. Raja Ayyanar?nilal- So we see if you can reproduce up to here. Raja Ayyanar?nilal- Yes. yes let me put the whole code here this code is a type it something about that also oh yeah figure size might as well bring that up so. Thank you. so answer is there a code completion to use my charm or something yeah i would suggest kite uh sorry not kite kite is one very good one another one is the pilot the co-pilot from microsoft but co-pilot doesn't have an integration which later to my knowledge and but this nv extension has a lot of code completions filter lots of extensions that do code completions but at least go integrate with kite this guy tab 9 many many things but the king of the hill these days seems to be this copilot which is based on gpt3 i i didn't know to my knowledge copilot doesn't have an integration directly with gptep but it has it for with the vs code so how did you figure out the completion? Because it has indexed the APIs. How does it know the values and things like that? See if you use things like copilot etc. they are literally using NLP and API to build that. They have a giant transformer model, GPT-3. Pretty much see, it is a mix of memorizing and guessing and inferring. A model that has so many billion parameters, hundreds of billions of parameters. You realize that somewhere in there, in those billions of ways, there's a lot of information that's essentially been memorized and along with it is also our ability to interpolate and interpolate to infer things yeah yeah this is just the data you can by the way you don't like complete graph you can use anything you want that line right doesn't matter so what how does it take two times to do this no no no uh see nodes right in a graph they're just nodes and edges that's all yeah yeah that is it so 0 to 19 is the name or the level of each of the nodes first node is called 0 the last node is called 20 20 nodes, you're creating 20 nodes. In regular form, how is this data stored? Oh, you mean how is the data stored? Just as pairs, from A to B. So you would, I'll show you. We'll come to it in a little bit. We will literally come to it. Let people finish this and we are coming in this notebook itself so guys while you're doing this let me just give you a don't try to do it with files you know what we did with the previous graph? Don't try with complete graph. Guess why? Yeah, it'll never stop. And again, it speaks to the limitation all those libraries they need quite a bit of scope for improvement network x is mature other ones are getting there i graph is good i didn't introduce Come again. Are we here guys? Is there anybody who's still waiting? I hope all of you are able to see a beautiful graph like this. Are you? Good. So now let's go to some real life situations. We'll take only two real life situations. Let me give you the history of it. What happened is that in some university there was a karate club. Karate club I believe had 78 members and those 78 members at some point they had some relationship, friendships and so on and so forth. So if you look at the social relationship between them and a particular data scientist, Zak, a statistician looked at it. So let's draw out that network. Write this code. This is, by the way, one of the landmark networks. And in the simple category, think of it as the Hello World. It is quite literally like the Hello World, not the Hello World, the Irish data set. Remember, in tabular data you have the irish data set and in images you have the handwriting you know the digits data set in the same way for networking world think of network visualizing network theory network science the karate club is about as simple as it is. And it is based on reality. So what happens is the moment people write an algorithm to create communities, discover communities, or whatever it is, they all, it is almost necessary just to apply it to the karate network. Just as people in data science, in the regular data science, they always apply their algorithms to the IOH dataset, however silly it looks. It's just a tradition, we do that. in the regular data science they always apply their algorithms to the irish data set however it looks it's just a tradition we do that so in this world it's the karate data set so write this code and see what comes out and i won't show you what comes out i will let you see it for yourself you would realize that almost all the code is exactly the same as before as the previous code that you wrote there's very minor changes so you can just start by copying your previous cell and then looking for what things need to change sure Nice. okay i have a payment from chinma energy who is that from uh who is that from chin may energy would be a tuition payment from chin may energy it's on behalf of i don't know okay i'll have to figure it out. E aí interesting interesting the previous one worked and this one is giving the tuple error i don't know why no this is because you're trying to render network x strange it's giving you a double error but the previous one works is it previous one works huh strange now i'm scared of running this code in my Windows machine. I don't use Windows ever. This is one of the things I have to learn to run it on all operating systems. Actually guys, this is the last time we're having environmental issues for all other courses now. We'll give you our Docker instance. Are you all familiar with Docker? Yes. So we'll give you a properly set up docker instance i was tempted to do it this time also and i realized some people may not be familiar with docker you'll all get a docker image with proper environment setting it will be ubuntu because you want to i mean linux is what i'm familiar with and so obviously with docker you have to more or less go with Linux because Windows etc have the licensing aspects. So even now I'll upload a Docker image for all of you guys and some instructions. All of you who are struggling and now it turns out I'm trying it out on this laptop and it's misleading so um Okay. okay okay Okay. I can get the circular one working but not the spring layout one. Yeah, hold on. Strange, it is failing on my machine. Strangely. Okay, so we have the circular one that works. Zachary is failing for you, is it? Yeah, Zachary is failing for spring layout. If I replace that Po is equal to spring layout currently or if there's po is equal to nx or circular layout karate that'll works okay why don't you post your solution to slack so everybody can see that everybody who's sorry yeah i'm not going to so if you want me to show everything is working. yeah so guys, this is how the network will look, by the way, every time you run this code, it looks like you different. Because it will be rendered it slightly, but basically what you notice in this graph I don't know if you can tell is that a few people are quite influential like, for example, this person this nodeosoever it is, has a lot of people who are its friends, isn't it? And then there is another person here with who exerts a lot of influence in this graph. Right? So it takes a little bit of training to see how many, like if you look at a guy and the number of friends he has and friends he has, you soon figure out who are the key players in this room, in this club. And what happened with this club is there was tension and the club broke apart, right? There was a breakup. So when it broke up one of the things is it became two clubs there were two people who were influential and i'll just give you an insight if you re-render the same graph the only thing you change is you change the layout to shell layer means all the nodes are put in the periphery edge and then you see the connection so what do you notice in this layout you can see that these two guys do you see where my mouse is guys these two guys are important if they fight there will be trouble does it say that like would you infer that if this is the friendship network and these two guys fight there will be a lot of problems here and sure enough these two guys didn't get it wrong one was either the administrator and the other was to provide trainer or something like that and they fought and when they fought this network split into two so that's the history of this so today one of the basic exercises, algorithm for machine learning exercises in network science is, can you predict just by looking at the graph, the structure of the graph, the geometry of it, can you tell what will be the two sort of groups that will emerge when this network splits? And generally, it's a benchmark. Any algorithm you write, you have to try it on this. And what happens is the first person who studied this, scientist who studied this was Zakari. When Zakari studied it, he predicted all of them right, except for one particular team member, team member number nine. I should have put labels to this. You can add labels. So you can see where nine falls here. Other than that person, everyone else he could correctly predict that will belong to. That's a pretty low error rate, one out of 78 notes. So it just goes to show that there's a whole mature subject out there that does it. We have taken the Zakari's Karate Club and we have re-visualized it as a shell. We want now shell layout. Why am I seeing two copies of it? Zakari's shell layout and then import load. Okay. layout and then import load okay now the same thing if you want to do it as five is you could do it in five is also again click it and run it it will become kinetic club I'll show you what it what it will produce it will produce a network like this once again again, you can play around with it, track with it, move people around and see what will happen if I do this. What would happen if I take this guy out to see who are the influential guys? Obviously, it has to be these two people are here and then you have this guy. This guy pretty much can create a decedent. Right, so this is it, this is how you could do. A graph that you can visualize it now network network science is a broad subject, as I said, I actually gave a pretty long workshop on. workshop on it but as you do the machine learning courses here you will even if you don't do network science i will be introducing you to example when you do deep neural networks we will be doing a lot of network these days graph neural networks are pretty hot geometric neural networks are very hot so they are giving you the state-of-the-art performance compared to and beating a lot of the compared to and beating a lot of the classical approaches to machine learning. So we'll deal with that. Is it also because of IoT? Yeah, you can use IoT data. Now network, graph neural networks is the new thing. People are realizing that geometry is far more central to machine learning and gta networks than they thought okay so we are now for the first time going in the direction of things like algebraic topology homologies and things like that very abstract math fields in machine learning it's no more that let's just create a few layers of fully connected nodes, neurons, or CNNs, and you're there. Now we're getting into more. So anyway, this is that, and I won't at this moment push you to do it. I'll give you the notebook. Facebook social network. Now you said that, all right. There is such a thing as, so this one guys I want you to do let's do this type this bit of code humor me and type this better so those who are having problem with the notebooks like like because of library issues, they can run it on Colab. Colab seems to be working really good. Oh, that's true, guys. Go and open in Google Colab. Go and run this in Google Colab. There, these things are working fine. I don't know what that is. Colab. That is a good point. Colab.research.google.com Colab.research.google.com collab.research.google.com collab.research.google.com so if you go to collab you can create new notebooks and in this notebooks you can repeat what we have and a collab environment is really well set up it will all work out of the box it will work you won't have the problems that you're having in these local environments is it a paid no free it's free uh the paid will just give you better notes it's one of the loveliest service that google has given for data scientists free jupiter notebooks and they run pretty fast actually and you can save these to your drive google drive so from your drive where it says plus new you can say new collab notebook there's an option so you don't need to go into the website so directly create from your drive all right you don't need to do any local settings increasingly the world is going towards that people are realizing that softwares have become so complex that being local setups is hard so let's run it inside docker or run it to the cloud collab this location is collab.research.google.com yeah and i can choose a file from my uh my computer the one that i'm working on right and then run it yes actually this much code could you please just paste it to slack it might be better because that url is just today maybe i'll do that maybe i'll do that oh there it is so guys just copy it from slack into a note into a cell avanti you'll have to upload your notebook into into google drive your personal google drive and then open it there then it will open as a collab notebook okay i'm trying to upload it right now yeah just say upload file and then it will open as a collab drive okay i will try give me one there is one directly you can upload also i guess no need to use google drive yeah you can directly upload that's true guys um are we all done with this line of code it is it is there it is there on the slack it's copied oh yes okay there's always something there's always an issue limitations just have to copy the imports I can post that online one second yeah okay just an fyi i don't have to get on my box i got to work with curl curl is fine. Curl, Wget, whatever you have. So 4000 nodes and 88000 edges. That is right. It's a pretty massive. So social graphs tend to be huge. The full Facebook graph, of course, will have billions of nodes and gazillions of edges right so this is a very small subset it just shows us a specific you know a social graph between a few people so guys if you have made this part work if you have to apply the apologies i have gotten so used to working on linux i keep forgetting the machines like this yeah i work on google cloud for my day job right so i used to i'm used to unix for a long time now yes windows is difficult to work with i know yeah windows is a bit tough to work with i know yeah windows is a bit tough to work with the only windows i ever use is to teach you know because of the writing pack writing part you know this writing board doesn't work with linux so now i'm going to move completely to mac because mac has a unix like syntax yeah my mark Mac in the back end is BSD Unix. That's right. So it's livable. It's beautiful. Windows is rotten completely. It's tough to work on it as a developer. Everybody here in Silicon Valley is dropping it. is all right your next one spring layout and then it's not going to work on windows yeah all right guys so if you have that code which you ran now, let's let's draw this exactly the same code that you wrote before. We're going to use a spring layout and we are going to render this and I want you to run this code when you run it. It would be time to take a little break. So I'll leave this code when you run it. You should get this beautiful, beautiful visualization. You see this visualization, and I will leave this as on your machine as a reward. That will take a while to run, but I will just leave the code here. This is the code you have to run. To run it will take you five minutes. I'll take a five minutes break get water and then i'll catch up with you guys after networks we have one more family of visualizations those are map visualizations or geolocation visualizations Avanthi, are you okay? Did you get to run it? No, it's giving me error plotting on that as well. None of my graphs are getting plotted on Colab. At least here somewhere. What is the error? So this was, I have one single notebook for everything that I was doing today. And when I opened it here, and it just started giving me error from the very first plot. Like the very first plot, we did the line plot, it started giving error right from the line plot. Have you copied saying libraries correctly find me have you copied the libraries because uh you wouldn't be able to run support vector style ip that notebook so i pasted a cell with all the inputs so just copy that and run it in the beginning and then you start running it and set latex to false just now you know i posted one cell before that right it says run support vector style ip ymv i can post it yeah i i yeah i did um you did that okay yeah i already ran all of this. Everything else works, but the moment I start the I want to post the error you can post it so we can have a look. I could, I can see the data frame. The data sets that we had earlier on the line plot came then when we started improving the line plot improvement, the plt.style use dgplot that's where it starts. Okay, fail to process string with tech because latex could not be found, but I already have that installed on my computer. It's okay, it won't work on Colab. So you need to set all the native to false. Okay, and how do I do that? There is cell like set latex right use latex set it to RC text text use text text equal true make it false i'll just show you everywhere that is a simple everywhere okay yeah so just make it if it works yeah it'll work i just posted this okay that line make it false yeah i will have to go do it for everyone right let's okay the plots are not as pretty but at least i have yeah it won't be as pretty because latex is not there right so yeah okay okay thank you i am working on running each and every one of them yeah sure if there's any other error just let me i will thank you so guys have we all typed this in by now this code should be looking very very familiar you draw the nodes you draw the edges that's it you set a layout and you give it the graph to draw how many of you are finding this straightforward now by this time? It's working well on my computer, but it's Ubuntu. Kate, I can't hear you. My Ubuntu system is working fine. Yes, of course. Aren't you happy you have that nice laptop with ubuntu it's a six pound clunker but yeah the gpu is nice okay i okay again here i'll have to do the latex thing right okay again here i'll have to do the latex thing right i made it false everywhere Harini, are you and Avanti in a breakout room doing your own screen sharing? You can do that. Zoom supports that. You can have breakout rooms. Okay. The only thing she needs to change the latex, otherwise she's fine. Oh, she's fine. All right. How many of you got the the Facebook graph? Looks beautiful, isn't it? Exactly. What's that? What does it show? Oh, we'll we'll discuss it. Yeah. One. Let everybody get there. OK, maybe. So, guys, have you all copied? Have you all typed this code? Anybody is still waiting. OK, maybe. So guys, have you all copied? Have you all typed this code? Anybody is still waiting? Okay, I'll show you the graph. So guys, this look at this. How do the social networks look? Do you see quite often, they are in the social world, there are people who are highly connected, they are big influencers, everybody, these are people who are highly connected, they are big influencers. Everybody, these are the, think of them as local celebrities or social celebrities. Do you find these clusters of communities of dots, communities of nodes? Like here is a community, here is a community, here is a community, here is a community. If you think of it as laid out on a land, this often looks like if you look at the dots and you think of each of them as, I don't know, a house of people. But this almost looks like a map of the world, of some city, isn't it? Almost. If you just look at the dots and not the edges. People are clustered here, there. If you look at night scape of cities, they often look like that. What it shows is that people attempt to form communities. The graph, the social graph is independent small communities, which are all interconnected. Right. This is one interconnected graph. And it has the loners, it has people who are really far out. And it has people who are big influencers or highly engaged in the society, central to the society. are highly engaged in the society, central to the society. So network science is a broad thing. One of the goals of network science often is to find the pivotal people, the really high influence people. Why? What could be the value of that? Right, they could use it for advertisement, but it could also be used for a good purpose. Let me mention it. There was a company, this is a real use case talked about in Paribas as well. In one company, the management felt that whatever they said, you know, whatever changes they made or the communication they gave, through the chain of hierarchy, through bosses and so forth, directors, VPs, et cetera, came down, people would not trust it. They would not believe it. And no matter what, there was a lot of mistrust and rumors and false, what I would call, falsehoods in the beliefs, misperceptions in the company. So they were all very confused. What in the world is happening but they are being as transparent as they can but the people don't seem to be listening to that or believing that so one person with Network science background all he did is he found out who is talking to whom right how he just looked at the exchange of emails who's emailing whom and so forth how are the people were related in the in the company and what he found is that typically in a company you have you know the guy who is the ceo is most influential that he has the c circle of executives then and so forth the power seems to be like that but that is the stated power what really happens is there are certain people who are practically invisible. They yield a lot of power in organizations because everybody trusts them to get the information. They feel that these guys really know what's going on. In this company, it turned out to be the printer repairman. Because every department, every floor or wherever there was a printer problem he would go and fix it right in those days printers used to be people used to print a lot today we are going mostly paperless but in those days a lot of printing happened so he would go everywhere and he would gossip and people would tell him things he would tell them things so he became a de facto became a de facto disseminator of information as well as misinformation right what would you do in such a graph you'll see that he has a huge number of connections it's called the degree how many edges are connected to you the degree of this node this person was very high. So what do you think the management should do to make sure that misinformation and rumor doesn't spread? Make a guess, what should you do? I'm a good guy. You tell that person. You fire the person. Well, you'd have someone new in this place. You influence him. No, you can turn him into an asset by taking him, sitting him down, and educating him properly. Telling him what the real facts are and what is misinformation. Convincing him of that. Because if you can turn this guy, you now have a means to spread the right information throughout the country. But how was he spreading information? This guy's what this guy would say he would tell everybody. How did they figure out the connection? The email links. Who is emailing whom? But how did they figure out? He was not sending email. No, no, no. People were somehow socially connected to him. It left a digital trace. So who is the guy in the company? Because within companies also, people exchange messages, right? I think, I don't know if it was some other message or not. People keep exchanging messages like mailing lists, sub-devices, or nowadays Slack. So you just see who, if two people exchange messages, you put a link between them. I see. That's it that's an edge and so people are the nodes edges are if they communicate it at their point mainly that they would email you if there's a filter problem and then they saw that this guy's common no they must have excluded that they actually it wasn't that they did something i forget the exact detail look into the privacy he has this case study. And he brings it up as a fact that see these networks when you visualize them, no machine learning needed. Just visualizing the network and the answer stares you in the face. Again, a tremendous power of data visualization. So that was one of the things that people were actually against to this freedom of speech and all of those things should still be in the open that's right so everything means yeah let's see let's see what goes on by the way guys if you try to if you try to take such a big social gap this is not big this is tiny and you try to visualize it in uh this thing a pipe is it's hopeless it takes a long time to render very long time to it does come through eventually and you can engage interact with it after that but it's it gets harder and harder all right so this is it i will stop on visualizations there i have just touched the tip of the iceberg because we had limited time, but I wanted to make sure that you just showed, wouldn't that be like a basis of the entire influencer mentality, right? Like you influence, you give money to them and then they sell your product. Absolutely. How do you think the influencers are identified? Oh, yes. That is it thank you all right guys so now we will take we have five oh it's five o'clock i don't think we'll take a break are you guys game for more or are you tired now and want to go home i have many things left What is left? I have many things left. So officially about an hour left and let's see. Okay, how about this? We give a half an hour or so to maps and then we do the presentations. And 3D visualization, I'll do one of the evenings. I'll send you guys a note saying today evening I'll do 3D visualization. 3D visualization is a big topic I don't want to waste and the other thing I didn't do is interactive dashboards which was to use streamlets. So if we go and look at the topics that I have kept for today, see what all we did. We did wealth of nations, line plots, muni barriers, density estimators, network visualization, map we will do now, presentation of the projects we'll do now, but there are still beautiful things missed out. We haven't done 3D visualizations. We haven't had time to do streamlit, and we haven't time to do, many of you, have you ever seen this uh three one brown have you ever seen this visualizations like this are you familiar with the vision of the youtube explaining the math and things like that let's go into calculus and the essence of calculus let's say and you'll find that on the youtube you'll find beauty actually let's go to youtube anyway i won't go there you guys go either you know about it if you want to create beautiful evocative videos showing like you know the animation that you did taking it to the absolute next level you have to learn how this very influential videos three blue one brown videos were created they're very very i mean it is literally injecting joy and math joy into mathematics through visualization, right, and making it easy to do. That is the Manim. And we didn't do that, but I don't intend to leave any of this. If you folks are willing to come to those evening sessions, which I keep giving periodically, I want to cover all of these things. So I want to cover this, this and Manon. But today what we will do is we will do. Do you want to check how many presentations? Yeah, how many of you have presentations? Avanti I know has presentations. Who else has? It's really short. Like there are only three grams that I could do. Okay, still is something. So we'll keep some time for that and then guys the rest of you have done not even tried what's wrong i think the covid virus has done something to your motivation so all right it is what it is but so we are going to do that. Let's get into the map visualization now. Map is straightforward, it's not hard, but it is worth doing and we will do it. Or maybe I'll just walk through that because we're running out of time. But guys, promise me that you will practice because otherwise all this effort as coming together doing all this, it goes to waste. Right. So this is on the maps. For maps, you need to import one more library called Folium. So please okay so we don't have time so I'll just leave it, but the important library is. is folium this library. So let's do one thing these days, apparently I don't I'm not into sports at all, but. Harini and Kate. mentioned there's something called the Australian open tennis tournament progress. I mentioned there's something called the Australian Open Tennis Tournament Progress. Now, some of you probably have been watching that. So let's find out where is it happening. If you Google it up, you will realize that it's happening at this coordinate. It's in a city called Melbourne. These are the coordinates of Melbourne or the stadium where it's happening. So let's take that and let's create a simple map. Let's actually, let's do one thing. Okay, just to humor me do at least these two parts. Imports I will paste onto the, oh yeah, you already did help me. Thank you. You have put import folium, do that and then maybe you can put all the imports and then this part of the code I want you to pack it please do that. All you're doing is location, longitude, latitude, latitude, longitude. Please type it in and see if you get this beautiful visualization. Are you all done with this? So I will actually, you know what, because it has these numbers which are hard to remember. Let's put it on the, Heidi, let's put it on the slide. And I hope you would agree that this is very simple code. You're saying draw a map centered at this location. Latitude longitude in Australia this is it so you you realize that this map is attractive isn't it beautiful with just one line of code you could do so much. No, no, no, this is open source. It's an alternative to Google Maps. But because we don't have geocoding, geocoding is the process of translating a location into its longitude latitude right at this moment it's a little hard so what we did is we just use google to find that location and copy that one we can go to google map and copy the code but what we are using is an open source folium which is sitting upon you see this open street map? So this is open source data mapping service. Let me know when you guys have reached this part. Have you reached this part, guys? OK. So now this is good, but let's customize the zoom and extent. Let's really zoom into it and see. Looking at it at this level, it's too poor screen. This is hard to see. So we can zoom in and you can give the zoom factor. Of course you can press this button, but you can give the zoom factor, so it's here. And you can specify the minimum and maximum zoom. When you do the zoom, you should now just add this three lights, zoom. Start zoom at 17 and the min max is just 16 and 80. And beyond that, it won't let you zoom. So my guess is that Grand Slam Oval, it must be this Grand Slam Oval. Is that where the thing happened? Or Margaret Court Arena or Margaret Court Arena? Okay, so this is where the whole thing is happening. So this is your way to visualize data, visualize locations. And I hope you all agree that it's very easy to visualize it. Can I move ahead? got it okay guys so now this is one way now let's do something more there is a concept of tiles see guys this image has been drawn by stitching together you know, there's tiles, you know, the word geography is divided into tiles and they're different, think of it as repositories of tiles that people use out of which an image is tied to them, right? A map is tied together. So you can, there are quite a few famous, like for example, there's an open street map. You could see that this thing here, open street map is one. There is Tartan, which is another. Tartan is very bare bones. Here, Tartan. Then you have, and then you have a few others. So I won't go into all of them. But instead of this very beautifully colorful map let us go to a more bare bone words it change over tiles to the same code but we'll change the tiles to starting toner and then you can also add multiple uh information uh information to this when you do all of that so you can you can mix and match and do a funny stuff to this like get some information from one tile set there's another information from the other tile set and so on and so forth so folium tile layer there's that add you can add multiple times and add the control stack of pancakes in there right so so guys at this moment i won't explain this uh here do you notice that this thing is there let us go through them this makes it this you can go to open street map changed over to this, you see that we have all of them, then you can go to starting train. watercolors but makes it look like a kids. This is how this one looks, and this is how this one looks rather dark. this is how this one looks and this is how this one looks rather dark so do you see this guys you can do this this code you know you to you to reproduce it it will take time we can just copy this what you're saying is that you're making all of these different tiles available tiling systems and it helps you this visualization helps you choose between them decide which one you like by clicking on this hand so this code is already there on polian i mean on the slack you can take it so so far good what do i do with these apps now let's try to get useful first we will start with the california housing data which many of you are familiar with is house prices in different locations in California. These days, everybody seems to be worried about high spaces. Those people who live in rentals hope the house prices will crash. Those people who live in homes hope the house prices will double. So in California, there's quite a pasta and everywhere, I guess. So you have this data just to recap. You have that to your bedroom, certain properties, population, household, media, etc. We have this data. Now let's take this first. What we will do is we'll put it on the map of California. So let's start with the map. Let's look at the open street map. You have, you know the longitude, the minimum latitude. So you see that there is a min and there's a max. So you want to box it in, the longitude, latitude and so forth. You want to box in so that you can see the map of California that is relevant to this data. When you do that, you end up in this situation. You make a map that is specific to literally, you find the center latitude, you find the center of California and you just find the center of California, and you just plot the center of California. Say go plot this map, put California in the center of this map. So you'll get a map something like this. Now those of you who know California, you'll find it, that it's basically the San Francisco metropolitan area, the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and a little bit of Sacramento, but and the rest of it is and then San Diego is here. In between is the central valley, Fresno is in the central valley, and then Sacramento is its own valley. Population centers are from Los Angeles to San Diego and around San Francisco Bay Area. So you draw the map. Now what do we do? Map is good, but we need to put some data on top of it. So let's do that. You take the housing data and for each data point that you see, you go and make a circle. So up to here was easy map so now you add circles to the map very very straightforward solid circles folium dot circle for every data you go and put a circle wherever the data point is when you do, you get a visualization like this. So guys, at this moment, I want to move faster. So if you can copy through, then it's fine. If you can't, don't worry, you will get the notebook and you can reproduce it. So you see these things, right? The circles. Looks good. You get a sense. Do you see, you get a sense of the population centers can you see this the los angeles san diego population center and the san francisco bay area population center and a little bit of a population center in uh sacramento here see a set of population going along modesto merced fresno not along i5 actually i5 is here going through the middle of nowhere but there is this other state route what is it called 90 99 yes 99 this is along 99 all the cities through the agricultural wealth so now it looks good but it would be nice to see some gradients of things so one of the things is that the standard color maps of matplotlib prove not to be very effective for folium there is another library called branka so make sure you have you have installed then pip install branca that is something we missed documented do pip install branca and it gives you some good color maps for literally maps geographical maps so then everything else remains the same the only thing we do is that we apply this is the extra you start applying This extra paragraph. Yeah, so you can study this later, but all it does is that it applies it based on house data, house value. How much is the median house value, house price? So it colors it based on that. Low income, I mean, less expensive houses are yellow, very expensive houses are red. When you do that, what does this visualization show you? Where are the most expensive homes? In the population centers, Los Angeles, San Diego area or the day. So this is it guys see how much you can say now we did not exploit the size of the bubble yet, that is another dimension you could exploit use that for, I don't know whatever you want now there is a concept in maps called the coro plate coro plate is of course color excuse me my throat is sore from speaking coro let's color some map imagine that you have a crayon and you have to color the entire map with some color. What you do is you break it up into something, let's say the states, each state or you know counties or cities or zip code, but each region will get one one sort of a color. What we will do is we are going to take something we are going to take the united states map and we first take the map and just do draw the color visualization without any data so how would we do that here we'll transition to to Plotly actually, it's more convenient. Take Plotly Express and you draw something called a choroplet. Why is choroplet using Plotly? Because Plotly sits directly upon D3 and D3 gives you beautiful choroplets. Support. So you now build a choroplet. What are you seeing? All the states are the same color. Isn't it guys? We haven't put data on. Now is the question. Now our job is to color each of the states because you are doing the location mode state, US states, which means that there is a geometry file somewhere that that is helped building the state boundaries, so it will pick that up and you're just setting it to the colors same scope us you show it lovely we got a map of the US, what do we do with this now let's do something. R. Vijay Mohanaraman, Ph.D.: let's go get some data, so the data that we get is we look at the unemployment, there's an unemployment data set. How bad is the unemployment situation? So you go and get a data set which is here. It is all there on the website. You get the unemployment data set and what it says is for each state, it tells you what is the unemployment let's look at this you get the state current unemployment rate right so you have that so for example a which state seems to have a pretty high unemployment rate i see 4.8 here louisiana oh even more maryland 5.6 5.7 6.2 6.5.7 6.2 6.5 so California has the highest oh this is sorted in the order so whenever this was dead done California was doing rather poorly I wonder what type what is the date sometimes time what looking into so it has been taken you have this data this is the code by the way all of you are familiar with the state codes ca is for california so now this data set of three columns we are going to apply it's very very simple when we do the choroplet here look at this what we didn't give look at this what we didn't give we didn't give it any data at all but now let's go give it to you very easy to give it data all we are doing is you have given it the data frame and you have said locations are identified by code color is given by unemployment rate isn't it you want to color it by how much the unemployment is and once you do that the rest of it is exactly the same what happens guys you get this beautiful visualization this visualization is called core of breath right and you can go here and see californ code californ ca current unemployment rate is 6.5 so you say all right this is good this is the color scale but um there are certain things we can do by default we haven't given it a color map guys i'll pause the recording for a moment guys

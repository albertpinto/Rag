 So, first things first. If you go to your labs and homeworks, you'll notice that today's, there is a documentation here that I have uploaded. I would encourage you to download this into your local machine and unzip it. Java AI Microservices in GCP, Quarkus, GKE and DGL. See if you can find it on the internet. I mean on the course. That is one. The second thing is the tree pilgrims. This is the second project. We are looking at transformers here. This is the second project that we have to do. So I'll just click on this right here. Should we do that? The same spec we saw on slack yes yes with minor things i added your poem to the end all right guys so this is it and i'll spend some time i suppose talking about this project the first one was eloquent Transformers. This one we call Tree Pilgrims. Now the purpose of this is to distinguish between what tree does this look like? Can somebody identify it? That's definitely a weeping willow. Yes, it's certainly We want to distinguish between this and let's go down and another tree. So this, of course, if you look at the tree bark or the tree trunk, you can tell that this is a pepper tree. And of course, you can spy a little bit of pepper here and here and so forth. Little pepper fruits in this image. So the context is like this. Consider we are an ecologically motivated organization named the Tree Pilgrims. Our goal is to apply AI and computer vision techniques to travel, identify the trees around us and bring out their beauty for the world to appreciate. Through this, we invite people to spend more time sitting under the beautiful trees and cultivate a relationship with them. So that's our context. There's a bit of introduction at the end. So the idea is that you should be able to recognize any tree but because we have limited time and you would have limited data excuse me so therefore just distinguish between the weeping below and peru can tree these are very common i think if you just walk around your house you will encounter these the weeping below and the peruvian trees I would suggest taking a walk around your neighborhood and looking at a few of these so you have a clear idea what is it that you're writing a classifier for. And these certainly are beautiful trees. You can spend a lot of time and just take a book in hand and sit under the trees and spend some time if you are so inclined. So this is a computer vision problem purely. Now you'll be using machine learning models. Now I'm asking you to make five different models. The simplest of which is at the bottom. Just make a simple logistic regression model and see how well it can classify between a weeping willow and pepper tree. Deliberately, I took these trees to be somewhat close to each other. In other words, it's not very obvious. It's not that we are comparing a palm tree with an oak tree. In which case, the differences are pretty obvious. We are comparing two trees that are not exactly similar but there is some similarity between them if you look at it from a distance. So see how well the logistic regression does, how well the random forest does, then create simple feed forward network, no convulation there, see how well it does. Then home grow your own convolation network and try it out. Now for these things, your convolation and so forth, you'll need a lot of data. So when you gather data, this is something I want all of you to do. See, you need to pull in your resources, create an open directory in Google Drive or somewhere where all of you go and see all of you if you get, let's say 10 pepper trees and 10 weeping willows, you will, between the whole class, you'll have 200 pepper trees and 200 weeping willows. That will be a pretty rich dataset. So the dataset problem can best be solved only by cooperative work. See if you guys can do that. Get good pictures, characteristic pictures of whipping willow and pepper trees. And of course, if somebody finds an open source collection of these tree pictures, please share it with everyone so you guys can use that. Lastly, the easiest one of them all is at the top, which is just use a pre-trained model. Take, I don't know, VGG16 or whatever you like, ResNet and so forth. Apply to your problem and see how well it does. And use the tree data set for just fine tuning. When you are just fine tuning, you can get away with small data set sizes. But when you are doing it from scratch, you need more data. And one easy way to get more data, if all you have is 200 of each, you can use data augmentation techniques these segment augmentation techniques come built in with torch vision so it will crop rotate do all sorts of things add noise and so forth to the data all right so play one of the things i want you folks to do is to play around with data augmentation techniques because in real this is real life guys when you have to deal with data you know unlike the benchmark data sets you know ImageNet and C400 etc which have been you know well curated tremendous amount of effort has gone into preparing those data sets real life is when you're trying to solve a problem, one of the biggest hurdles you'll face is data is not there and you have to go gather the data sometimes. Either extract it from raw material, extract it from the database, do all sorts of processing, or quite literally go hunt for it on the internet. So this sort of is a taste of real life, guys. Do that. Now when you get data, you need to squeeze the maximum juice out of it. So do not ever underestimate or forget to use data augmentation techniques. We talked about it early on, I believe in the very first or second session, week of this long workshop series, we have talked about data augmentation. And PyTorch and TorchVision comes literally built in with it you can add it with a couple of lines but do data augmentation techniques and do that it will be useful for both combulations and feed forward right and of course random forest and logistic everything will benefit benefit from it. Pre-training, you might get away without doing data augmentation, but that. Are we together guys? So there are a few questions that you need to address. How does the performance of each of these models compare? Observe all the classification metrics on your model and note the differences. Also now that you're going into production, one key factor is how much is the cost in time to perform inferences. So you get a user request, user submitted an image. What is the inference time? And think about it, how does the inference time relate to the classification accuracy of your models? Make a plot of it, see how well they respond to it and see what you can do about it or what you learn from that. There's a lot of learning in there when you do this. How long does each of the approaches take to train your data set? That's another thing. How much is the training time? Is it in minutes? Is it in days? Is it in seconds? Is it a week? I did that. Finally, and this is for ensemble learning, now that you have built five models, why use only one? Why not create an ensemble of all of them and stack them? Put one more deep neural net layer in front of the five layers and stack them so that the output of each of the models goes as input to the stacking feedforward layer. And that stack or support vector machines, as one of these, that will do the final prediction based on the predictions made by each of the five models. We train it together and see how well it works. Then the other thing that I emphasized is, we need to explain why you made that prediction. If one thing we learned from this workshop is explaining your results, your predictions is important. So we have done those things in your lab. Just use that. Use Shapley, Lime and Captain. Those things you can take from our lab session. And from the library documentations, put it in the UI. Give an explanation, highlight it. When you say red, like this is a pepper tree with 90% probability, you should also highlight what regions of the picture made you come to that conclusion. So it is worth doing that. Lastly, do a neural style transfer. So what is a neural style transfer? This is an artistic rendering of a tree. Like of a weeping renault idli. How did we come to this? What I took these images hang on and obviously i didn't write the code i was there i just took the website you take the original image you take some artistic rendering and you apply this style onto this tree when you apply this style onto this tree it will become this. And of course, this is just not the best of styles to apply to a tree. I think Monet would have been much better, but this was a quick work. And you can see that it has elements of both. It has elements of the style as well as the tree in it. So that is it. You need to do neural style transfer. Then have the user experience. The user can either upload an image or provide you a link to an image. So you should be able to work with both. Use your Streamlit library to get started. Then today I'm going to teach you some things of how to you know sort of do more robust production environments. So as a starter this is a stretch goal. You may not be able to do it in two weeks, but I'm going to certainly walk you with the code and I hope that some of you do it. What if you used a very high performance Java back end? Now Quarkus is basically J2EE. As you know, J2EE was spun off into an open source project, Eclipse Jakarta EE project. One of its high performance implementations comes from JBoss, Red Hat and JBoss, who are fairly dominant in this community, and their Quarkus framework, the microservices. One good thing with the Quarkus is, unlike other Java frameworks, like say Spring, et cetera, Quarkus compiles straight to native Linux binaries. That is one big advantage. The other big advantage of Quarkus is, deploying it to cloud, especially Google Cloud, it is almost, it's a complete no-brainer. It is almost as easy as deploying to a local machine. And I will take you through those steps. So what it means is that you have a very rapid iteration. You can write your code, keep editing your code, and keep pushing it to the cloud, and keep seeing the, you can affect the production behavior very rapidly. You don't have to go through an elaborate process of deployment. None of those even Docker deploy or Docker file. Imagine that you're able to create microservices, containerized microservices, Dockerize, without creating a Docker file at all. And when your application goes, you have a choice of either as keeping it as java class files a jar file or making it into a pure binary and i will walk you guys through it now those of you who have worked with c c plus plus and etc and you know that native binary code runs orders of magnitude faster than scripted languages like Python or JavaScript. It's much, much faster and much more robust because 30, 40 years of investment has gone into, more than that has gone into the multi-threading model, the concurrency model, and the maturity of those languages. So I personally find that deploying microservices with pure native code, written in Java, Java gives you a very clean interface to write code. With Java Kotlin Scala, by the way. When I say Java, I mean each of the three. You can pick your language of choice, if you like Kotlin, Scala, by the way. When I say Java, I mean each of the three. You can pick your language of choice if you like Kotlin. For example, many of the things I'm moving personally to Kotlin, but I still am heavy on Java. Scala I was though, frankly, I'm withdrawing out of Scala. But you do that, but you can deploy and then see these languages are very good to write code, very structured code you can write. then see these languages are very good to write code, very structured code you can write. And, but there's a learning curve to it. I will assume that most of you have very basic familiarity with Java, assuming, but in any case, I'll explain to you the code. And then on the front end, these days, more or less, when you create enterprise class applications, the front end, these days, the reigning king when you create enterprise class applications, the front end these days, the reigning king of the hill is React.js, and the second is Angular. So I have mentioned React.js, but if you prefer Angular, use Angular. A bit of experience in my team. For many, many years, we used Angular. We stayed with Google as it came up with more and more versions of Angela. But recently we did once again an evaluation and we realized that React actually has a lead now in mind sharing components in many ways. So we are in the process of ensuring that our new applications within my team are developed in React.js. So that is something for you to play. The learning curve of React is very, very low. You can get productive in half a day or a day. So what are the machine learning libraries we are using? We are using, of course, PyTorch, Torch, Vision, Shap, Lioncap, Terms, Psychic. You'll realize that we have the code, practically you will see that the code of almost everything is there in the labs. This is the art of putting it together and doing it as a real project. All right, this is it. Now one thing that I haven't seen you guys do is create a proper white paper and presentation. Do that, guys. Ultimately you want to write an article on your experience of learning this or so forth. You need to put yourself on the map. It's important to write articles. Post it to any of these places. See, places like Medium, you can have two perspectives. Either you can aspire to put it there when you're starting out or you may later on when you mature. Like for example, I don't put it there because it looks awkward because most of the articles that are there, they are sort of people who are in the early stages of their career who have put articles there. But since you guys are starting out in deep learning, it will put you on the map. Certainly you don't have to put it in Medium, put it in your own blog, but put it and then make a reference to it in your LinkedIn profile that this is the blog about your experience or so forth. Trust me, those blogs get discovered far more than your resume and those blogs will have recruiters chasing you. So that is that. The rest of the things are the same, collaborations and so on and so forth. I've kept the project very simple. Most of the pieces are from your lab code. So I'm expecting that in two to three weeks you'll finish it. So do your milestones and get over it. I will do one thing today. I am going to. So some of the helper code, literally all the code has been released. It's a 20 hour project, guys. but it may take you more if you're completely new to WinTools or if you need to go back and review your notes or the lab notes and so forth. So any questions, guys? Does it look easy and straightforward so far? Those of you who read the instructions, were the instructions clear? The instructions are clear but there is many parts. Yes, there are many parts but as I give you a hint, most of it is from your, literally the code is there in your labs. There's also the back end to tackle that's new for a lot of us. There's also the back end to tackle that's new for a lot of us. No, see, here's the thing. You don't have to. Like I said, doing that part is a stretch goal. You don't have to do it. In the first part, just do it with Streamlit, the way you did the transformer project. Do it exactly like that. Ignore the much more enterprising way of doing it with Java and all that. No, we do want to deploy it and productize it. Oh, that's right. That's right. So yeah, I'm taking you to. So the cloud part and the Docker containerization part, I'll walk you guys through today. That is the crux of what I'm going to talk about and walk you guys through. So if you download it, did you guys download the tar zip file that I gave? Yes, sir. This file, have you guys unzipped it? Let me point it out. This file, guys, it's in your lap. Yes, you have. So if you do it, I'll just open it on my local machine. So I've made it into an HTML file for you. But if you allow me, I'll just open it. Maybe I can do it as a HTML file. Chrome Quarkus, GKE, HTML. Actually, let me open it as empty because if I notice that something needs to be done, I can keep fixing it and updating it also. In case something is unclear, I'll add additional instructions to it. So if you open this file, it should look something like this. Is it looking something like this guys? Yeah I'm still opening it. Okay. So, where's the Zonvy plus equal? Where's the equal symbol again? Oh, sorry. Zonvy plus... Give me a second. Sorry. Okay, this is the file that you have. Let me walk you through what you have. Markdown file inside that folder? No, no, I have given you the HTML. Okay. Yeah, it's folder upload. Yeah. Actually, let me use the HTML itself so there is no confusion. But if I have to update it, I'll have to update it. I exported it to HTML so that it looks exactly the way it is because every markdown looks differently on different machines. So I wanted to take precautions. All right, guys, so we are going to use two principle technologies for just the containerization and go to cloud. And we will use a particular Java library, DJL, to load our PyTorch models, our Python models created, but load it for inference into our microservices. So the first part I will talk, and I don't know if we'll get time, because I want you to do it as we move along right so first of all guys on your screen let me start with this go to your google cloud console cloud console console if you go to your cloud console which is cloud.google.com, actually this is something I should mention into the doc. Right in the beginning. Let me add it here. Visit the cloud dedicated project. Oh yeah, log into, yeah, I have mentioned it. So you should log into your Google Cloud Console here. Let me go to your Cloud Console. If you click here, you will go, and assuming that you do have an account with Google GCP by now, all of you, what you need to do is, and I'm taking you guys to complete scratch. Right? What you do is, do you see this API projects and so forth? Ignore that actually, no, it is because first of all, I'm logged in as the wrong person. We log in as support vectors. Can you increase the font size? can you increase the font size yes so let me show you see in my case guys are many accounts okay so are we all here well I see for in it is yeah guys, because I have many accounts on this machine, I have to switch between them. Okay. Okay. So once you are here, you should see something like this. Okay. Do you see this selector project? So before I do this, do you see this selector project? Before you come to it, you should see a dashboard of yours, right? As you can see, I've already been started raking up a bill 836 and so forth. What you do in the selector project, if you have a project, it's fine. if you don't have a project what i would suggest is create a project called event 400 how would you create a project go to the top here do you see this location guys go to this and now you can create a project and associate a billing and so on and so forth. Let me see if I have added that instruction to this. Yes. So yeah, so you can create a new project in this example, call it project ML hyphen ML 400. Just so that we are all on the same page. Create a project by this name. Oh, okay. Once you have created this project, and remember guys, this project, you have to be careful, you will start raking up bills. So I suppose that should be a motivation to you to finish your project within two weeks so that you don't rake up more than $20 to $25. Right, and you can of course share it amongst the three, for our partners that you are so that each person gets a $5 bill hopefully, no more. You say location as no organization. our partners that you are so that each person gets a five dollar bill hopefully no more you say location or as no organization come again i'm going on the next step i gave it the name project dash ml 400 now it wants a location now should we just keep keep that alone yeah in my case i keep it support vectors.com but you can browse and you may have multiple locations ids like which is the billing account it will be right so put whatever you want whatever it is relevant in your context and just create a project a project is just an outer container for billing purpose. Now I want to hear if all of you have successfully created a project by now or not. It's complaining that it's not unique. Oh yes, so well okay in fact in my case it is project MN400 so call your project Dashcade or something. Yeah call the project whatever you want to call it. One suggestion I would give is because there are so many accounts and things that get involved, I always put the name spacing so. So between projects and parts and, you know, instance, groups and so forth. So what I do is whenever I name things I put a prefix. So if I say group hyphen something or a part I'll say app hyphen this or something like that. I try to namespace it. You can follow or not follow that convention, but it doesn't matter what you call your project. Call it whatever you want. Let me know once you have succeeded. After that, you go to the container registry. Where is the container registry? Container registry. So, okay, before we go further, guys, are you all there? Have you done, Kate, are you done with this? It was hanging because it didn't like the non-unique name. So I just did a refresh on the tab and I have to try to get back there. Okay. I'll wait for you guys. I have created the project. Okay. Anybody else who is waiting to create the project or has not created the project? Today is a very long session guys because I'm taking you through a long practical journey. Not only this, this is actually some things that most people, see going to production is always a weakness for developers, for data scientists. They always shake in their boots when you say okay take it to production and now we're going to hit you with them you know a million traffic a million hits a day if uh i think i was just caught up between some uh some uh because here so i downloaded the file finally it got downloaded and I was trying to kind of listen to you and try to take it. So inside the file, you'll find a webpage called qarkus-gk.html. It likes project name ml400-k. Yes, that would be good project. Yeah, ml400-k. Did you succeed in creating the project and? Yeah, it requires something unique there. Yeah. Put something unique. Sheenie. So I'm not I don't see that HTML page under like. Unzip that folder. See what is in there. There's only one file there in that. I did unsave. I see upload enter that enter that upload okay what do you see there i see okay i see that you got it yeah so i'm getting here now open that file and you'll see these instructions open it in chrome firefox safari whatever i think you cannot see those images i think do i have to change a path or something those images should show i have i have put all those all those in Put all those in. Yeah, I mean, I see the help file images. But when I click on it, I can see the HTML page, but I don't see the images. Why don't you share your screen? Share your screen? Did you? I'm looking at straight from the zip file. No, I did extract it straight from the zip file. No, I didn't. I didn't expect it. Yes, if I went on the screen, the support. Not one of you share your screen. If you're having a problem, share your screen. All right. All right. Is anybody able to see the images? I tried to select the Kubernetes and it said not available and now it's offering a Compute Engine API. Okay. All right. Open it with Chrome. It's coming here. What? Okay do me a favor do you have a command line? Can you please go to the command line? Yeah and go into the directory. and go into the directory okay let me see what is going on here is anybody able to see the page properly i can see it properly you are able to see it properly okay anybody else praveen what about am i able to see uh safe so all right it looks fine now i, if you just open it up as HTML without changing the folder structure, it works fine. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So who is not able to do it? I think, Shini, I'm not seeing your screen anymore. Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out which is my directory. While you figure it out, who else is having problem? Anybody else? Me. figure it out who else is having problem anybody else me is being enabled it might take a minute okay it's still yeah Did you unzip the files? No. Now, do Ls. Yeah. Just do Chrome. Chrome. Do you have Google Chrome? Chrome or maybe Google Chrome? Yeah. I think if you have Chrome, you can do that. You just do open space corpus dot html. Okay. Just open this by whatever you need to do uh so i opened it here it's in my browser it's in your browser in the chrome um it is in the dot cache no yeah you're not opened it in the browser rafiq you are still looking at it in the dot you know unzip it you are still looking at it in the dot, you know, unzip, attach. Correct. Okay. Yeah, I double click there. That's why I think. So, okay, so I will fix the path. Just literally copy it from the console and put it here. From the console, just copy it. the copy. Yes. created the micro services. Okay, now from Rafi. Yeah, click on the HTML. Okay. So those of you who are not able to use because you're just clicking on the zip file and hoping that images will come in. you're fine now anybody else sheenie yeah i'm just sorry i'm trying to get there kate how about you i am now creating the ml 400 microservices you are already okay you're following you're moving along with the instructions okay guys so then i can already suffer trying to do their hello world tutorial on the google kubernetes engine website for a bunch of today and it was having weird problems so i'm glad we're stepping through this now this is a little easier yes so these instructions guys have written carefully so that it's easy this is the shortest part to get you guys deploying your projects into the cloud we don't need to enable this kubernetes engine yeah i'll take you guys through it guys please please bear with me we'll follow the instructions so you will take step by step, right? So I've just created the project name now. Yes. Okay. I'll see if I'm sharing my screen now. Wow, okay. One second. So now go into the directory. You are in the directory. Now open Chrome, whatever way in this operating system you do it, this toy system you do it this toy system Chrome and then give workers GKE that's it see Here and you don't have command line Chrome Google You use open OPM space causes now A person yeah one person yeah it's coming to my chrome but i think okay just open a new tab in chrome can you open a new tab in chrome yes um you know i want to see chrome command shell please okay there it is i have to close everything good okay all right and feni what i did is just on on the explorer just go click on the double dot html file right rest all it's all mapped to defaults right if anything convinces me that you guys should all move to a genuine operating system like linux the mac is lin. It's a unique system. She finally created mine. Lapsody or something they cloned. Yeah, they cloned. Yeah. So can we move forward? Is everybody in a good place? Create a new project, please. If you already have a project, that's fine. That too is fine. So, Asif, can you help me here what do i do here do you see the menu my first project here so in the drop down you click on the drop down do you see the new project in the top right in this dialog click on that okay yes now create your project name, give it a unique name. Okay. Better not to give spaces in the name though. You know, ml 400 dash your name or something like that. Okay. And organization is mandatory or optional? Yes, you can click on that and put otherwise leave it no organization. It is optional. Okay. Cancel, create your project see guys gradually once you start working in gcp you'll realize that these things matter your organization and these things matter so for now it's okay if it is i mean sometimes you get away with a lot in the beginning but eventually make sure you configure your gcp environment So all right, now enter that project, enter that project, the created select project, do you see a dialog called select project? On your right hand side? Yeah. You can do it, you can go from the drop down again, you're in that project. So now follow along what I'm doing, guys. Anybody else who needs help reaching this point? Have we all reached this space guys? Speaker days, I don't want to get quiet. Yes. Yes. Yeah, it is important that you stopped me if you're not able to reach him because we won't get a second chance. You don't want to be left behind. Second thing we will do is in the top menu here, you see this thing, search product and resources, search for Kubernetes engine. Or you can navigate it on the left hand side, but a better, just in this Google Cloud platform, there's a search menu. You can just search for things. So just search for Kubernetes Engine. When you go there, you will realize that you don't have any clusters there under Kubernetes Engine. First of all, it will ask you to initialize the registry. Do you see Container Registry? Oh, no, sorry, before I even go there. Go to Container Registry. Search for container registry. Sorry, when I open the Kubernetes engine API... No, no, no, don't. First go to container registry. Search for container registry registry as my instruction says it's important you will see a dialogue like this a message like this are you guys seeing it yeah yes please click enable container registry ah maybe must be enabled yeah for me it says billing not uh registry api okay so it says google container registry provides secure private docker i i didn't use the search bar on the top the search bar which says search product after that and i said enable container registry yes did you do that then wait yes i want everyone to reach this place is there anyone who has not yet reached this place instead of that enable container registry the button says enable billing then you have to yeah you have to set up your credit card bill first. I'm assuming that you have a Google account so far, cloud account if you have not if you're really at that level that you haven't engaged with it at all, then get out your credit card. So I see if we're getting this container registry dialog, it says container registry provides you secure and I see the button dismiss on activate. Do we need to activate? Yes, yes, activate your container registry. Just enable it, go through the process and make it run. Once you're done, are we all there, guys? Some of you are still taking out your credit card? I'm trying to get to the part where it says container registry. I'm in that Google. At the top, Kate, at the very top, do you see the search bar? Just type the word container space registry thank you looking through that hamburger menu won't get it there but searching on the search bar will get you yeah that's wow that's tricky okay got it that's why you know in the instruction i very clearly say search for it in the top search bar of the page very clearly say search for it in the top search bar of the page. I said, but then how do we know it is working like exam? What will happen after I do that? Will you wait and see? We are going through those steps. So like in the menu, if you go to the tools, the third menu is the container registry, like if you want to go through the menu, like on the left hand side, towards the middle down. Okay, I'm on the container registry and it says all that but it doesn't have that bar to say enable. So if you have, did you already enabled it? Did you credit card etc. there? I've given it my money already. I've given it my life. What is it? In your case, it may already be enabled. Yeah, I think, Kate, you've already been working on the tutorial, right? Yeah, but it kept crashing. It kept claiming that it didn't see my project when I tried to push the Docker image to the cloud. This particular part of it, you might have already already crossed you've already enabled it in your earlier efforts okay let's know me what you what what your container registry page shows okay share your screen so I don't have that bar here and I've already been. Right, you have no images. It's enabled and you have no images. That's fine. This is where I am also now. Okay, wonderful. By the way, go back please once again. You're moving too far. I've been doing a lot of this already. Yeah, right here. From the repositories tab, you're in the repositories. Okay, yeah, you repositories tab you're in the repositories okay yeah you're fine you're in a good place it is all enabled okay then wait for the next instruction now okay yeah didn't see the nodes though that's all yeah you need only once you know you enable it for only once basically yeah so it'll be good if you could add that right. If you do this, this will appear here. So we will not go back. Okay. I'll add those things to the instruction. So guys, are we here? Is there anybody else who is getting stuck here? Let me take some random name. Shiva, are you fine? Yes, Asif. Until this point, yes. Okay. Next, again in this top side, where see guys, here's the thing, the menu item on the left is very long and deep and it can, you know, get lost scrolling. So easiest is just to search at the top. Search for the Kubernetes engine. And when you search for the Kubernetes engine, your top menu, top left-hand corner should say Kubernetes engine. your top menu, top left hand corner should say Kubernetes engine. You should be ready to create a cluster. So click cluster, create cluster. See, some of us might need to enable it as well. Yeah. Go ahead and enable it. Enable it. Yeah. Can you take a screenshot of that and send it to me? Because see, I've been with GCP for a long time. So none of those steps come. So send me a screenshot of whatever you're facing when you're doing it for the first time. Too late as if I've already gone past that now. All right. It's all right enable whatever needed to keep enabling it i'll put maybe i should put a instruction here that you may need to enable it yeah enabling has taken some you may enable uh okay sir i have shared the screenshot on slack oh excellent Okay. Thank you for this. Activate. So you clicked on the activate, is it? Yeah. Yeah. Excellent. I will add it to the document. Nice. So guys, once you do that that let's go back to this so as if other is you can also add the api and services like you can go to the api and service and look at like all the apis which are enabled so that's another like good place to look at what is enabled and what is not and then there are many ways i'm giving at this moment. I completely agree with you. There are many ways to slice and dice this, but at this moment I've kept it to a simple reproducible set of instructions. In other words, I tried it out on people who were new, completely new to follow the instruction in QA that they're able to reach the destination. So we will follow this. So guys now go create a cluster and call it whatever you want. I've called it ML 400 microservices. And when you create a cluster, see here's the thing, when you create a cluster, a dialog like this will come up. Now creating a cluster is a complicated business. So we'll go through it step by step do not in a hurry click create cluster at the bottom don't do that go create a cluster and pick a region us west so as if i need to catch up because I'm a bit behind. I'm still setting my billing account. I don't know why it's still stuck there. So you guys can go ahead, I'll catch up. All right. So after that, I took this because of best states, they have GPU support, etc. At this moment, today we won't use, but we may need later on. Once you are here guys, at the bottom, don't click create cluster. You go onto the tab. Do you see here, there is a tab called, there is a thing called node pools. You see where my mouse is guys? Yes sir. Click on the node pools. I don't see the node pool the left side yeah we don't I also don't see the note I see it well it's not on my page you mean like default pool or like the node pool? You can just click on the, in the node pool says the title and the default pool will be there. Under, I don't see a cluster basics. I see. Oh goodness. Why don't you share your screen? Let me walk you guys through it, because if you are not. One by one, can you share your screen? Okay. I'll start first if that's all right. Yes. Okay, I'll start first if that's all right. Yes. Asif, while Kate's sharing, what was the rationale for picking US West and not Central? Because we are in the US West. Yeah, we're in the West. Central isn't West. When I was playing around, I kind of felt Central is where all the resources were. So I thought you had already reasoned out that West is better than Central. No, see, here's the thing. A lot of the GPU support used to initially be only in the West, but now I think they're propagating it everywhere. I'll have to check the latest. So, okay, let's take that question later. I'm helping Kate. So Kate, you seem to have already created a cluster. Do you see ML 400? Yeah, I have it here. Into that, click into that. So what you did is, what I was saying is don't click create. You seem to have created create. So now what we will have to do is, it doesn't have a node pool. So you'll have to, so here's the thing. Delete it. uh node pool so you'll have to so here's the thing delete it delete the cluster let's uh so no i think kate you can click on edit and you can go to the notebook oh look there's a node no no no click on the edit and if you scroll down uh you'll see the node pool bottom but now your instructions will look different from what I'm taking you through. Yeah, but like the from the menu perspective that node pool is there and it has the default pool like which is created. Okay, so the node pool, select the series as n1. I mean if it would be simpler i can just delete it yeah yeah like your instructions work okay let me just that's fine i haven't done anything so guys be patient as I said again and again, do not click the create cluster button. I mean, I mean create button when you do that. So go back again please. Oh sorry, hold on. All right, so I'm back here. Yeah, you have get rid of it. You can delete it at the top, you see the delete button deleted. Yes. Okay, this is good to understand how to backtrack. Okay, because I don't think I saw. Well, it said optionally go now to the node pools. Yes, I didn't. Now you follow the instruction, Kate, literally as it is given in the notes. Well, I thought I was because I went down to that. And then it said optionally about node pools. See, one thing that you may do is, see, I'll tell you why it is important. It is optional, but we need to do some configurations with it. So guys, is there anybody else who has trouble reaching this far? Just creating a cluster and giving it a name? No. All of us are here, right? So then you go to the node pool. Are we having difficulty clicking on the node pools thing on the left hand side then you bar and giving to this thing default pool and then what you do is on the default pool do you see nodes yes so what you do is leave the image type in doctor and so forth change the series it is cheaper to use the older generation. This moment you're just doing development and playing around, no reason to use more expensive hardware. So change over your series to N1. And choose your machine type to be 4 CPU 15 GB. So I'll tell you things that you don't do in production and typically you don't use such like we don't use such small instances for AI we use large instances. The other thing is that we don't use standard disk, standard persistence disk car that we don't use standard disk, standard persistence disk are those mechanical magnetic disk spinning disks. The choices are standard persistence disk or SSD. SSDs are orders of magnitude faster. Today a typical magnetic disk will have a read write random access read write of 10 mbps a typical ssd will give you a random access of approximately four to five gigs per second so in production you use ssd but you make your clients pay for it but since you are doing development just pick standard persistence and reduce the size to you may want to reduce the size to 30. these are just ways to keep your costs low guys and still have a pretty powerful instance so you take 4 cpu 15 gb or if you want to be conservative pick 2 cpu 8 gb though at that moment things get tricky when you do machine learning inference it may not work so are you guys all here up to this place yes sir okay so keep it cheap while you're doing development and of course you can do other things compute memory right at this particular moment it is okay to go and create that cluster and once you when you hit clear it it will materialize the cluster and it will start running the one thing to know which i warn you is that once you create the cluster remember the billing starts right and since i'm bringing so many customers, it seems to Google today, maybe I should ask them for a kickback. I'm joking. All right. Asif, below it also asks for maximum ports per node. Yes. So what happens is, I should explain that. Well, that goes into, yesterday I mentioned that Kubernetes takes multiple instances of your application, roughly speaking, right? And it elastically scales it out. So where does it scale it out? Underneath there is some hardware onto which it will scale out. So these nodes are the physical hardware, as close to as you can get to physical hardware. So suppose you have 10 nodes. I'll take an illustration. 10 nodes and you want to illustration, 10 nodes and you want to say the minimum number of pods should be let's say one but the maximum number of pods should be 50. Now what it means is first of all in the beginning it will create one pod then two pod then three, and then suddenly 10 pods will be there. So all of your nodes are occupied. Like if you have 10 nodes running, you might as well have 10 pods. They'll be spread across all the machine. The 11th pod that you create will be randomly assigned to one more machine. So now you have multiple pods running in a node. Got it? running in a uh running in a node got it so now from horizontal scaling you have started doing vertical scaling because now multiple of these parts are popping up on the same machine right okay so now the default is maximum parts per node so we just leave it like that just leave it aside don't worry about that yes yeah i got to a point where now i can see click create cluster so you said something before creating cluster is there anything that i need to do no no no do you have instructions in front of you yeah follow it is exactly it just says you'll catch up in no time because i haven't gone very far okay we'll just follow the instructions i've got my notes properly and i'm recreating the microservices cluster okay now comes the next step guys so we click on create sir come again uh again. After doing the cluster, all the defaults, whatever, then we say create? Yes. Here are the nodes, like what I did first. So remember, at this moment, you have created a cluster with a few nodes, right? In my case, three nodes, and then your default is three. So remember, you are being built on three machines. Okay. Right. So that's why that warning. are default is three so remember you are being built on three machines okay right so that's why that warning right so even if you are sleeping you will make up a bit of a cost the next step guys is to now install the uh google clouds uh you know the s the SDK or the console locally you don't have to do that a lot of people just go to the cloud they literally give you in the web page a shell cloud shell GCP shell I know being from a Linux pedigree I guess I like to run things from my command line him So I don't trust that. I mean, I can, I suppose, but I prefer doing it from the command line. So how do I do that? Go ahead. So it's taking time. Yeah, it takes a while to make the Yes, green cluster will take time because hardware resources are being allocated. So imagine that some little, what is it, elf is running to the hardware store buying hardware and coming back okay so as if it says insufficient regional quota to satisfy request there's something weird about your project why don't you create a totally new project give it a credit card and do it it shouldn't be like that or Or you can change your zone, you know, you can change from West 1A to 1B or something like that. Or worst case, I don't know why that should happen. I've never faced that. I hope you're not using your company account because there are all sorts of weird restrictions are there. Oh, no, it's just anybody else facing such an issue. So I've faced this in the in the past, and it happens when you have you're trying to get a GP or something, and you still haven't given your credit card and activated the account. In the free, you're not allowed to use a certain set of resources. If you try to pick any of those resources, then it won't give you that. Yeah. Guys, when you do AI in the cloud, you're for real. You better start paying up. There's no two ways around it. Otherwise, you'll be stuck with colab and you know ten dollars a month and basically you won't be able to do a lot of things you can't take your software or your startup to production on colab colab is for so as if it says resource cpus requires uh 12 but you are given only four so the eight is available or something they may be having local outages just change your region doesn't matter go to something else right see if that helps you and make sure your credit you have set up your credit card. All right guys, can I move forward now? Yes, sir. Yes. So what you do is click on this link and when you click on this link, it will open this page. Now, this is an important page, guys. This is installing the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. Some people choose to, they'll tell you that why bother the web has a shell and we can do that. I'm not going to give you the instructions for that. You can just go to the cloud console and click on it and it will open up. But in my opinion it is good to have locally installed on your machine so you all have different operating systems right i'll pick your operating system whatever it is and i hope your operating system is ubuntu because then you won't have a problem but the sdk is pretty good by the way google sdk works just fine on everything we always move downloaded our files installables to like slash bin on our machine for this for this um sdk no just you know it ends up in my download file ends up in my download file i didn't understand you have ubuntu right are you on this page yeah yeah i downloaded the tar file no don't remember you're not i'm suggesting you don't go that route go straight with your native operating system, Ubuntu. Click on the Yeah, I downloaded for the all right. You can get away with the Linux, but I'm telling you that the most stable thing is to go native on your particular environment. Oh, there it is follow these steps guys there's nothing unusual you just have to go follow these steps so it's asking select components to install no cloud sdk code library share your screen please okay code libraries. Share your screen please. Okay. Oh, you're on the Windows. You don't get this sort of dialogue. Just install everything. Doesn't matter. Install everything? Yeah, install the beta command and everything oh it doesn't allow me to do cloud sdk core libraries and that it won't let you remove it it will insist on installing that you see the check mark there yeah yeah Anybody else is having problems guys? Yeah, I see. I don't see the screen where you know you have this node, the screenshot of the nodes. Okay, I'll come to that. I'll stop sharing. Okay, so Harini, you're done. I can take back the screen. Yes, sir. screen yes sir maybe i should share my screen why don't you do that remember when we started the workshop i said become familiar with gcp but apparently we haven't given it enough time so this exercise i suppose is useful because yeah now i'm taking it so you're right you have three notes running do you see this yeah um i was i was you know i did all this and then i was hoping to see something like this because you're saying here n1 series and all that so i don't see that have you yes you didn't What happened is that you did not go to the default nodes. Please go back to your screen. Yeah. Okay. Just this nine, your micro CPU. See what you have done. Okay. You did not follow the instructions exactly, but that is all right. You ended up into medium. So you feel like doing it again. It's optional. You don't have to, I just followed here. The point is you clicked on create. Yeah. I clicked on create, not, you need to go to the note pool. If you want to have a less expensive option option you have to follow the step right below that which is the optionally step so i think you can mention on the document do not click on create yeah maybe i'll do that yeah see it there's no harm it's just that you're paying more money for less okay so you want me to just delete this cluster and recreate one? I mean I can do that. Don't bother. Let it be there. You can follow the instructions later on. Okay, all right. Make progress guys. It is, we are moving very very slow today because we have a long journey to do. Okay, so I should then jump to now here, connect to cluster or you want me to go so when you when you are here so let me bring up my installation notes yeah so you're here what you would do is oh yeah so install GKE locally, go here and literally follow, control shift, follow the instructions guide or wherever the instructions go, installation guide. Follow the installation guide for your specific version of the operating system. Follow all of it up to number three all of it and then here is the important thing from number four you must install this part so for that i have given you guys the instruction here that after you have done the you must install an additional component which is cubectl right that you see here in the additional components step number four the only one necessary optionally is the cubectl are you seeing it on my screen guys yes so you would say sudo app get installed or whatever it is in your case and cubectl because cubectl is the one that will help you see your containers running in the cloud sorry so cubectl is it k u b e c t l Okay. You guys see that? Are you able to run that afterwards? I have to search and... So in Windows, whatever the instruction is, guys, I don't know. So Windows, let's see what it is. How do you install the optional components download to sdk after installation has completed okay in your windows case you don't have to do anything don't have to do kubectl it seems so i don't know i've never used windows you'll find out in a little bit okay all right so i apologize i don't use windows it's hard for me to know what you should and shouldn't do but if you get stuck we'll find out in a moment so guys are we all there those of you back people are we all there damn it you back people are we all there. David. Yes. You're all there and you have also installed your install. Oh my goodness. Mac is so easy. You just in one shot go and install everything. Oh yeah. Okay. Other option installs. Are they installed options? No, no. That's what you see deal on Windows. There's a link to install. Okay. Go ahead and do that so as if you want to go ahead and install that right that's it yeah i suppose if you have the other operating systems do whatever makes sense there. I'm a bit handicapped guys. I don't have a point of reference on these other operating systems. Can I share my screen? By all means. I have this that has come up. It says pick cloud project to use. Pick cloud project to use. So you already created the project, no? Yeah. pick cloud project you see you already created the project yeah project ml 400 or something you called it just pick that enter that yeah so enter three there okay you want to configure default compute region and zone yeah just hit enter region and zone. Yeah, just to enter. How many options enter the list as the prompt? I think the number 11 or 13 is the right one. 11 to 13, you can pick whichever one you like. Okay. Okay. So what does this mean? It's done? It's done. Are we together okay good where are we right now so we are still stuck at the same place i'm helping people okay yeah yeah doing the i want you to know that at the end of it okay you're sharing your screen good what am i seeing now shinny okay so i was trying to install um and then it got me the error right like which error no g cloud crashed oh i have no idea Anybody who is seeing these errors. I'm sorry, I haven't seen that error. But somebody using Mac, Shankar, maybe you can tell what is going through. You use a map. So I think I'm using Mac. You're also using Mac. Are you not having this? So I just unzipped it and then the install.sh took like few seconds. That's all. So I'm not installing that. Okay, see if anyone if you can recover. As if when you run the G cloud in it, it is asking for login. Oh yeah, you have to log in, log in with your GCP, with your financial account. Okay. Google account. So that's normal, right? Every time you run G cloud you need... No, no, no, it will be only once. What it will do is, okay, that's a very good point you raised, I should mention in my document. When you do G cloud init and you authenticate once, it will put a private key on your machine. After that, you'll never have to do it from this machine. So that's the point worth mentioning. I should mention it in the docs. I thought I wrote a fairly detailed and carefully verified doc, but it seems no. I see the optional elements required. Yes. Cube CTL is important. Install cube CTL. The only optional element required is cube CTL. Okay. So can I take over guys and share my screen now? Okay. So when you run Google Cloud in it, remember to run Google Cloud in it. Let me add this instruction there. Google Compute Engine. It may ask you, it may ask you to log in. Credentials. for creating chairs. So guys, have we all reached G Cloud in it? Shini, any luck with you? Did you debug it? SHINI SANTURKARANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANANAN Yeah, I'm almost done, I hope, with installing the Google Cloud SDK. Let's see. For me, it says it doesn't give the connect button. You will always have a connect button whenever you do it will always it means that your instance is not do you see a green checkmark here yeah and you don't see a connect button how is it no I don't see it says no cluster selected See, go to Kubernetes cluster. I'm in the Kubernetes cluster itself. Okay, I'll just share so it's easier for you. See, remember you just now created a Kubernetes cluster guys. So here, can you see it says all this? Yeah, cluster. scroll to the right. I fully scrolled. You have to click on the three dots. Yeah, it has become. Yeah, the dots. The point is not just maximize your browser full of full screen. Just make it full screen. OK, OK. I'm saying connect here. Yeah. Do I click on connect? Yes, you can click on connect or otherwise if you by the way in future you can just make sure if you maximize your screen and there is enough space you won't get dots you'll actually see the button okay so now copy that and run it copy this copy this okay and run it. Put a command line. Yes. Hit enter. Good. Okay. Good. Now what has happened? I'll explain to you guys what has happened. But before I do that, all of you please do the cluster init. Gcloud init. Have you all done that, guys? So as if Gcloud init in the in the console right go to that location. Local console. Do it in your local console. Okay, I'm logging in with mine. Now authenticated with the Google Cloud SDK. Good. Very good. Now what you do is go to your Kubernetes cluster and pick that. So I guess at this point, I need to take over because I need to clear the screen. So guys, once you have done that, you go back to your, connect to the Humanities cluster, you'll see your cluster, click on the connect button and connect to it. This thing, copy this and run it on the shell, on your command line. The unit is actually asking you want us to run in cloud shell? No, do not run it on your cloud shell. Run it like the instruction says, copy the command and run it in your command console off the laptop off the development machine okay so on the other window that popped up yes just to drive me crazy it popped up in a firefox while i've got the other one in my crown chrome tab so see kate if you are doing it in the cloud shell i wouldn't recommend you do it on your Ubuntu has a console, no, it has a terminal. Do it in the terminal. Okay. And Windows terminal only popped up. Okay, good. So when you do that on your local machine, not on your cloud shell and so forth, on your local machine when you do this, then visit your home directory. By the way, tilde in Unix stands for the home directory. Whenever you see this thing, go to your home directory and you will find a file there in a directory called dot cube then you'll find a file called config see if the file is there you have the concept so as if once you are authenticated after running the cloud in it what is the next so So it's a- Next step is according to this, you go back and search for the Kubernetes cluster. You know, the cluster, Kubernetes clusters. Okay. Tap and you should see only one cluster, the one that you just created. Do you see that? Like this, Kubernetes cluster, you'll see one cluster there. Just checking. Copy. Yeah. First. Aftab, how do you go into the home directory in Windows? I have no idea who uses windows i don't know somebody using harini you're using windows yes i'm going into the folder into my c drive and checking yes your home directory it's typically user your name yeah c colon user then your name yes so that's where i'm going to the c users and checking and then find this directory yeah there is a dot cube that has been created dot k you can show it to the other person so that he knows where okay so c colon user and your your name should typically take you to the home directory and then in that look for a file called a directory called dot yeah so in in windows go to c user your directory and here you can see dot cube okay enter the directory and you see the config file open it you see the config file open it oh goodness how do you want to open so what do you want to do spy chat notepad yeah i guess so yeah yeah good so yeah so i'll tell you that do you see that you have your certificate data you have your this thing there now you have you should just read through it and see things and some of the things will make sense to you what i have to deal with okay okay guys guys are we all here are we all able to see this file in the dot cube directory the config file got the config file and ready to deal with um eclipse again i guess okay so hold on there we'll we'll get there now can you share your screen once more let let me sync up with where you are yeah so i'm here still waiting for people to confirm that they have run this command, connect to cluster on the shell. Can I assume guys that you all have and you have all gone and looked at this file? Is there anybody I need to wait for? I'm not able to see that. One quick file. Did you run this command? Yes. And are you on Ubuntu or what, Windows? Windows. Okay, so go to your home directory and look for the dot cube folder so i see that command you're highlighting in black, that needs to be done from the terminal, right? Yes. So if you click on this, you know, copy icon, it will copy it into your clipboard and then you just have to go to terminal and run it. I've tried multiple diagnostic things from Stack Workflow, doesn't copy also if i've tried multiple diagnostic things from stack workflow doesn't seem to help so i have good news for you okay the lambda lab is giving discounts yeah i got to do something so that copy doesn't work as if in the... Just copy the whole thing. If needed, just look at it and type it in your computer. Yeah, I'll just go and do whatever it is. Yeah. Remember, you're not copying from my image, right? You're copying from your own dashboard. Sanjay, I hope you're copying from your own Google dashboard. I can't hear you. SANJAY GUPTAVIAVARAMAKRISHNANAMI, Where can we see that? Come on in the Google dashboard then. SANJAY GUPTAVIAVARAMAKRISHNANAMI, Yeah. Could you please share your screen? OK. OK, so this is where I am. Now, go back to clusters. Do you see that back arrow? Yeah, click on that. Yeah. Now, so many things are here. Just kill all of these things and scroll on the horizontal scroll. Yeah. Dot dot dot. Connect. Copy this. Do you see that copy button is there? Yeah. Copy. Now go to your whatever in your operating system you're in a mac isn't it okay hit enter did you do gcloud in it i did i did all of this gcloud install the kubernetes did you install the kubernetes yeah that's extra extra component that you need to install on mac sorry say that again step number d go on to the installation page wherever you picked up the gcloud in it go back to that page um not not this one so the one uh assist at shad yeah the cloud.google.com go to that page go to mac oil oh yeah go go down go down go to this yeah go down go down go down to d go down go down go to this yeah yeah go down go down go down to d click on the option b you see a d that yeah this one yeah component manager yes go to that go down uh search for kub on this page it's quite difficult so just search KUB on that KUB yeah search again hit twice yeah just copy this and paste it on your website come back here and run it yeah yeah That should ideally take care. OK. Your Google Cloud itself is God knows where you have installed it. No, I think I have to go here. I think he hasn't put it under the path. He has installed it, but it didn't go into the path. Here. OK. You'd have to do dot forward slash gcloud. Yeah. So you should add these things to your user part. Error. You're currently working in the cloud the cloud SDK installed in order to perform this update from the command from outside the directory. So do one thing. Go global level down and then. Okay. Now do bin, bin, Google Cloud. Instead of .forward slash do bin. Replace the dot with a bin the word bin dot yeah bin yeah bin huh okay run this okay still complaining that okay i can go down further and then no so the right approach is to just put it in your path. Do one thing. Can you copy the directory name, users, documents, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Copy this entire directory name. Now write the word exactly as I say, export. I hope it works, export if it is any reasonable unix. Export path with a capital P a th is equal to. R. Vijay Mohanaraman, dollar part. R. Vijay Mohanaraman, colon. R. Vijay Mohanaraman, and paste yeah i'm not sure as it export works here i'll put been also here right. R. Vijay Mohanaraman, export slash bin yes. Okay. here i'll put bin also here right and yes yes yeah okay now all you have to do you don't even have to do any of this just say gcloud component install now hit enter Go to your home directory and do that. Good. It's done. Do you want to continue? Yes. Alright, so once this is done, then I need to run this other command. So now you're in business, huh? Yeah, I'll run that big command. Don't say okay, just copy that and run it afterwards. Go to your shell. I'll say we'll run that if you want to help somebody else. I'll say we'll run that if you want to help somebody else. Can I ask you guys something? Why do you even bother buying Macs and Windows for development purpose? Do you really find it convenient? It's just a frank question. I don't know because I don't use this, I'm asking that. I know there's a lot of people who use Mac for development. I've never understood why. So there must be something good, right? What is it? What works? I think it's just a default. It comes pre-installed. So no one bothers moving on. Yeah. I've been using it since my college days. So as an RA and then the company also provides some actual, Fisam, Docker, everything is there. Okay. Linux is it? Sorry, can you come again? You never got used to, you never got acquainted with Linux? Yeah, I was using the earlier version provided by or the Spark 2003 2004 IBM machines and then it was Mac. I never got used to Mac and Spark in those days it was all Windows then I shifted to Mac never looked back. It was a very heavy Unix user when I was really coding. Nowadays the coding has become less and managing so. As if Mac is just a bash shell. We have a terminal and a bash shell so Praveen, is it like, is there some script or some extra software that you can install on Mac that removes all of these, you know, these little struggles that these guys are having? No, if I didn't have any issues, I don't know. This is also a basic Linux terminal, right? Yeah, Bash is Bash bash of course yeah yeah okay guys so at this moment we will do this you have your structure running run this command from your command line assuming that your environment is let's do this sanity check so remember cube ctl is your friend guys cube controller is the same as on your Linux. By the way, this is Ubuntu speak. This language itself is Ubuntu. How do you, or in Linux, how do you know what services are running? You do systemctl, isn't it? The Linux syntax is systemctl, the verb and the noun. And the Google Cloud follows exactly the same syntax instead of systemctl it is cubectl verb and noun right ask a question for you like i need to then stop my google cloud right like how do i do it why do you want to stop we are still doing it no I am not able to do it this one. It's not at all. Hey, Shini, can I suggest to you something simple? Why don't you install a VM on it? An Ubuntu VM. See, there is something wrong with your host machine. We don't know what, but I have always seen you struggle with it. Why don't you start by installing an Ubuntu VM on that? I could do that but it would take the whole class down. Just have it because you have been studying for a whole year. Before we come and meet next week, why don't you do that? I think I should follow you guys but I don't want to get back to the gears. I didn't hear that sorry slowly no no i uh to take some time i'll follow as you actually watch you right now you may not be able to follow you so how do i stop my bill see do one thing can you do you think you can install ubuntu vm on your own i could try uh but just okay what i'll do is I'll create a VM for you. If I give you a VM, do you think you'll be able to run it on your machine? I don't know Mac how people run VMs. Something's called Parallel Box or whatever the software is. Somebody will tell you here. How do you run VMs on mac the virtual box is there right so the virtual box yes the virtual box of course the open source thing if you can install the virtual box i'll create the entire ubuntu for you ready you just have to copy it all right just copy it and do all your development all your ai work inside that. Any by any chance are you behind a firewall VPN or something? No, I deleted it. I removed VPN. Initially that is the case came out and Srini is this by any chance office laptop? It is office laptop right now. It is not the office laptop, right? Mine is right now. My laptop is still coming. It is or is not? It is coming. So it's still in mail. It is an office laptop. Right now my laptop is office laptop. Usually office laptops have obscure authorization and security things. You will have trouble with office laptops. Yeah, I also face the same problem. What did you do? You moved to a private machine or pure? Yeah, I actually ended up buying a new laptop. Yeah. Yeah, I actually ended up buying a new laptop. Yeah, because I every every step I was getting stuck and I installed a Ubuntu virtual machine but even that one I was having like security and some SSL issues and stuff like that. Yeah. So I think I'll stop running the machine. I'll just follow you. Maybe the cluster entirely because you're raking up a build there yeah how do i do it can you tell me just go there and delete it go to your okay i'll show you you go to your uh install i mean where is it your uh console okay okay and just go delete it. Hang on. What am I doing here? My home API, home API. So yeah. So what you would do is you would just do clusters, clusters. You go to Kubernetes and you don't have permissions okay because my selector project uh whatever project i was in project element okay when you do that you'll see your cluster and click on this and hit trash can so now let's make a bit more progress i'm not that command didn't work on my system cube ctl did not work on your system okay find out on your machine where cube ctl is and add it to your part do the same thing add the sdk to your windows path should i help you do that yes sir here your screen i'll help you do that so guys be ready to be here till midnight we have a lot of things or you know we can take it up in the next session but we haven't reached we are still setting up our environment good thing is if you have reached this far it will be a good milestone. At least your GCP account is now properly set up. Then we have to do the local work after this. Am I seeing your screen? Yes, sir. Okay. Now do PWD. Just do... PWD? Okay. I don't know. Windows, what do you call it uh open your explorer i think that's the word explorer something or dir you can do dir okay okay that is it install mode cloud where in the world has it been installed no go to c slash users. No, not C slash users, C slash Windows. Find out where this, you know, cube CTL is installed. Let's go find the binary where it is installed. C slash? C colon slash, CDC colon slash. Enter. enter slash enter anybody using windows knows where it is installed just do whatever dir so as if we can like we can run the command like jcloud components list and it should show whether it is installed or not ok just do that jcloud components list components list list is it ls yeah yeah yeah so yeah so your kubectl is not installed no no not installed yes you have to do that install first yeah no not installed oh okay so how do i do that now literally the command is in front of you yeah so gcloud component installed kubectl yeah component id no no just copy up to install okay and then type no no dollar sign no dollar sign please actually why don't you type it G cloud space components space install space cube CTL K u B E CTL CTL hit enter Hit enter. Yes, and then it should work. Anil, thanks for those instructions. And once it is installed, you can run that component like list again and then you work on windows is it mostly uh yeah because all my office work is in windows yeah like for last 24 years like only windows oh in my case i started in 1985 on a on a unix and i've stayed on that how many 35 years of unix yeah all right guys so now do cubes again yeah so now if you do that list again um gcloud components list uh you should say like it is installed hit the apparel it should be there hit the apparel yeah one more time one more apparel or list yeah that's right so the last plane yeah installed now cube ctl get nodes three words cubectl get nodes yes all your things are running good so guys this was the sanity check i want all of you to do cube ctl get nodes and that will verify whether your environment is properly settled is there anybody are you all getting this sort of a result or not something like this three lines yes yes Yes, I see. He's getting it. Yes, sir. All good. Now, do one more last thing to add support for the Docker containers because we're going to push those. Do this. Gcloud or configure Docker. So what has happened is the Docker containers now, people have made it very, very efficient. Then you don't need to write those long manifest, et cetera, et cetera. Things have simplified a lot over the years. And in fact, when we do, you won't have to create a manifest file. The good thing with Quarkus is that transparently, once your Google, see guys, so far we have just set up your Google cluster. Now that it is set up, you will see that working and doing the development is very, very easy. So now the first thing, if you guys don't have Eclipse, go to eclipse.org. Actually, that is an instruction I should do. Let me add it here. At this particular moment, Quarkarkus project first open your eclipse id so i should start with one moment uh see the previous command that you said gcloud author configure docker right like some of us at least i don't have docker in the path so it's just going to give a warning should i just ignore the warning and go ahead with it yes you don't need docker on your local machine at all okay so i'm going to give a warning. Should I just ignore the warning and go ahead with it? Yes, you don't need Docker on your local machine at all. Okay, so I'm going to just ignore and go ahead, yeah. Yeah, because the nice thing is the way we are going to do it, you don't have to set up anything locally after this. Okay. For me, it's saying I ignored it and just said yes to continue. It says Docker configuration file updated. Okay, fine file updated. Okay fine. Asif I don't have Eclipse, I'm installing it and it is giving me an option various options, so which one I should choose? Java developer. which one i should choose uh then you can do it with intellij but in fact pravin then you give me the instructions for the quarkus in there right there is a plug-in if you can take some screenshots and give me that will be good i also use intellij sometimes but java i do in eclipse and i have to do an intelligence so get the version this is a geyser so install eclipse from eclipse.org. Please install. So let me show you how one installs that. You go to eclipse.org. The first thing you'll encounter at the top is the download button. You click on the download button. You click again at the download button. Install your favorite ID. Do you see this guys? Click again. Then and then again a download button. And then it starts downloading. That's it. it. And once you have, I'm not going to do it because I do have, all you have to do is unzip it in some place. Also make sure that you have JDK 11 installed. Okay, that is another thing I should mention. See some of these things are so implicit for me. I have 15 that is good enough 15 is great let me answer that clips installed and i'm going to put in that module so here's the thing guys if you have 15 then when you deploy in the cloud in this you might have issues you might have issues because 15 is not a long term release 11 is the last long term release google is still on 11. oh right also compiling graal bm compiling to native binaries at this moment it only supports 11. so just install 11 also on a machine many of the jdks can exist after eclipse we need to install jdk sir before eclipse you need to make sure you have the jdk oh okay 11 installed right to install it reset let me give that instruction also how do you go open jdk go to open jdk and if you go to open jdk.java.net let me put it here open jdk i'll add the instruction visit open jdk and down to load the appropriate installation so in open jdk which one what do we do okay I'll take you through guys are we all here can you looking at my screen here right mine looks different open JDK how can the same web page look different on two machines it is okay open JD kill open okay let me open jdk open jdk.java.net is that where you are now i'm on the same page correct praveen you asked a question yeah quarkus tools or Quarkus run config? Hang on. Don't go to Quarkus, Praveen. Hold on. Let me help people. A lot of people are still stuck here. So, guys, you can have a base on the same code. Okay. So, you can go and click on the install. When you go to the install, you see all these Java versions mentioned here, 9 and later. You can go and download it are available on the really specific pages of java.net so you'll have to follow through with this uh it takes a couple of clicks i don't know here it is so when you go through these clicks ultimately you'll come here actually let me do this reference implementation all right yeah let me put it here the direct link the direct link to the k11 is here oh this is just the runtime or something platform standard edition. Okay, implementation reference implementation. Right? So this is it. We'll have to go here. And what you do is you just pick your own version. Whatever Windows, Mac, oh, by the way, what what do Mac people do? Anybody knows pravin how do you install java and max oh what is that how do you install java on mac brief uh there is everything uh brew uh just ask the gcss okay do you uh pravin do you have any instruction for that? I haven't done that. No, it's the, I have a blog, open up a new Mac so I can give you the link. You have to set up a home view. Anyone of you working on Mac, would you please give me some instruction with screenshots to add to this documentation while i'm still convincing people to buy one too um actually i searched java 11 on mac it says homebrew and i have a link with instructions okay let me paste it on the chat window oh yeah and let me add it right away to the documentation it on the chat window oh yeah and let me add it right away to the documentation i haven't done it myself but this is the first link i got nice on windows it's downloaded a jdk 11 zip file zip file okay then unzip it and add it to your part you know how to do that harini uh yeah okay add it i need okay it gets unzipped and then i need to add it to where windows part okay to the c drive no okay what you do is okay you'll have to share your screen share your screen i'll take you there uh pravin did you share that to me who said i think one of you wanted to share the instructions link yeah i just sent a link on the chat it's a medium link why am I not seeing it on this like chat oh I just let me post on the slack it's on the zoom chat but let me if you can paste it in this yeah yeah I'm doing that rename yeah I just posted it on the Perfect. Perfect. So I'll just say for Mac, follow these instructions. Okay, now I'm looking at the screen of whom? Harini. Harini, okay. So the JDK 11 came up with this. Now go to your JDK directory wherever you unzipped it. I haven't unzipped it yet. Please unzip it somewhere. Okay, let's open it. Unzip it in C colon Java. Okay, you're still learning. Where did you unzip it? Oh, it is here in the downloads. In downloads. Okay. Here. Okay, run that binary. Yeah, double click on it and just run it yeah no no no see you are looking at the zip file here you're not actually clicking on the binary okay the second file where is your unzipped file supposed to be here okay click on that whatever it is click on that and see what happens this only opens the same thing again yeah i can unzip it right again and on windows extract to c drive sir you want me to do it in c extract it wherever it doesn't matter you already have extracted it okay very good now what you do is go to your jdk-11 can you go into the directory and show me what that is yes copy see okay do one thing go your windows, like click on the My Computer icon somewhere. Click on the, yeah, OneDrive. Do you see this PC? Do you see the word this PC? Right click on it. Properties. Now, do you see advanced settings? Now in advanced settings, do you see environment variables? Very good. Now in the system variables, do you see a thing called path? One of the variable called path. Click on that, click Edit. Now we'll do something. Click on the. Click Edit. OK, now we'll do something. Click on the new button. Now, click, put C colon. Put the exact directory name JDK11 where you have C colon. Now, do you remember where you installed it? Yeah, I can find that. Yes, go here. It is in C colon. Open in Explorer please. Yeah, C colon JDK 11. Copy it exactly. JDK hyphen 11. Copy that. It doesn't matter. Go there. Go back to your path and just write the word. Type it in. Double click on it. Yeah, JDK. JDK-11. Little JDK would be better. hyphen 11 slash bin bin now now that you have this say okay okay now open a command line you know what a command line is a new one Just type the word CMD. Now just say the word Java space hyphen hyphen version. V E R S I O N. It entered. Java is not recognized. So it did not pick up go back to your environment variables let's see what is the mistake there path go back to path click on it edit click on it edit what's wrong with that guys does anybody see an obvious thing i should not use double dash it's just one dash version where double dash in the command so java dash first space dash version oh there's a single dash but it didn't even recognize java the problem is okay hit enter hit enter no windows are strange okay do one thing go into c colon jdk from the command line you know how to navigate from the command line how do you do that cd cd dot dot yeah go do jdk yes for c colon jdk if the i think harini opened that command prompt a little while ago right you modified the environment variable just now so she needs to open the command prompt again no i opened it again oh okay uh harini just go to c drive you know how to navigate directories from the command line just do c colon okay cd cd stands for change directory. Yeah. I don't see you do that though. CD. Okay. Okay. No, you have a colon sitting there, reverse the order say c colon that takes you to the home directory now do cd jdk hyphen 11. oh i don't know what this is okay just do c colon that's it i don't know how windows works c colon what happens no cd the the previous sentence cd CDC colon slash and put a slash also there. Yeah, now you're there. Do JD JDK 11. bin slash bin enter okay dir yeah do dir space java dot star star yeah java exe is very much here so i think what maybe there is copy that whole address c colon jdk bin up to bin yes copy it exactly Now go back to your environment variable, double click on it and just paste it there. Edit. Double click on it. And just paste it there. And just you might even, yeah, all right, let's do that. Now say okay. Okay. And now, okay. And now open a command shell. You know where the bottom left it says type here to search. I say cmd. Yes, good. Pick it up. Now do javas-version. Enter. Good. Everything is working now. So now you can install Eclipse. Double click on the Eclipse. Go to the eclipse.org website. It's already here eclipse installer yeah pick the first one eclipse id for java developers okay yes please pick that and this this is a perfectly good location go ahead and install it I have Eclipse installed, but the Quarkus installation is giving me errors, so I'm debugging that. Okay. All right, now you follow along, I'll just share my screen for you. Okay, thank you, sir. So one thing, one feedback though, you need to learn using the command line. The programming world is very command line heavy. So it's all right. You work on windows, but become familiar with the command line. Most things are done sooner or later through the command line in the development world. So go and learn whatever it is called windows Windows shell or programming. What is the right word for it, guys, Windows guys? Learning how to use the command shell? Power shell. Go learn PowerShell. Thank you. And also you get a Linux subsystem, WSL2. So it is almost like a Linux, you get all the command. Yeah. Sorry, what is that uh windows uh subsystem linux windows subsystem linux again ws2 or something you can google it okay i'll do that thank you thank you anil thank you okay guys we are here now are Are we all here? Have we all installed Eclipse and JDK? Is there anybody who needs help with that? Unfortunately, Matt, some issues, so no problem. I'm taking care of it. Asif? Yes? So I just downloaded the Eclipse eclipse installer which one should i click that first one uh for java developers yes okay Once you have done that, we need to install for then go through the installation Eclipse. install doesn't matter if you choose the second choice there you'll just end up with a like the EE you'll end up with more that's what you'll end up with a bigger version than we need, but it's totally fine. So how do we install the Quarkus plugin guys? I'll show you in Eclipse how to do that. So guys, do you see, are you all seeing my screen? Should I wait till you guys have the Eclipse installed first? Yeah, I think you should wait as well. Okay, I'll wait. Okay. So after that, should I say launch the Eclipse marketplace? Marketplace? Where is that? You launch Eclipse, right? Not the Eclipse marketplace. Yeah, after that. Yeah, you can launch the marketplace. Okay. And in the marketplace, search for Quarkus. Okay. So, you can launch the marketplace. Yeah. So, you can launch the marketplace. And in the marketplace search for Quarkus. Okay. Search for Quarkus is it? So here I'll show you. You go to the Eclipse marketplace from the help menu and you search for yeah it will it will first it will take some time to index it just type the word when you do that so let me take a screenshot of this uh spectacle yeah corcus tools 4.170 final yes it says install right should i install that yes please go ahead and do that yeah and wait a minute i'm waiting for other people like this okay okay okay okay Okay. Thank you. okay yeah so So guys, you should be seeing something like this and just click in your case, it won't show installed. It will. So you have to click on installed. Search for if the plugin is in the Quarkus. it for some reason it's not letting me install if i click on install it takes me to some to another marketplace and like back and forth it's just are you free let me look at it Yeah. Okay. Can you see my screen? Oh my God, am I seeing your screen? Probably not yet. Yeah. So, no, no, no. Why are you searching from here? Can you follow the way that I taught you? Get rid of this nonsense. I kept saying so. Do you see the cross button in this tab get rid of this go to help okay uh eclipse marketplace yeah so this is where i started uh now i can't now wait wait a minute just type the word quarkus Now wait, wait a minute, just type the word Quarkus. Yeah, that's what I did. So I have to browse for more solution. There's something strange. I also experienced the same. I think it's already installed. If you click on that installed, it will show you. I'm getting repository error messages when I install the clips. Yeah. So it says to restart the system to apply software update. All right, let's see. You don't have anything there. I don't know what this,'re also on windows isn't it so start searching for quarkus with a capital q yeah i i did that so when i when i find quarkus it takes me back to this place okay go down let's go down go down here no no no please go back to the window where you are maximize that and let's see what is going on search new membered. I search for caucus. And when I search it gives me this. When I click install, just click on install. It takes me back to the original. Okay, very straight yeah so i don't know what to do yeah okay it's weird is there anybody else who's having this issue i suppose my suggestion to you is it seems very cruel but it's the same thing go get a get a linux yeah i'm going to get the new one and i've installed it well just restarted it let's see if carcass won't stop i've never had these issues well it's sorry it's asking to restart shall i restart yeah restart it and you also just restart just see what happens if you restart restart eclipse restart eclipse. Oh, restart eclipse. Yeah, exit, exit, exit. And restart it now. In Windows, best solution is to restart every time. Yes, yes. Anytime you are in trouble, restart the whole machine. If all else fails, give it a shower. Would you help? A shower? You want us to bring our machines into the shower? It helps sometimes. You might end up buying a new machine. You're killing us over here, Austin. you might end up buying a new machine. You're killing us over here, Austin. Yes, I tried that, yeah. You should ask Lambda Systems to give us all systems now. So I think your version is like 2018 uh so maybe you want to install like 2020 uh eclipse oh is it your eclipse is old is it yeah oh i'm just choosing the old 2018 is ancient times like you know people will start writing history books on your eclipse get the latest one. All right, so that's one issue with you. I have Quarkus. I'm opening a project Quarkus. You are opening a project Quarkus? I didn't get it. I seem to finally have gotten Quarkus into my okay very good so you installed Quarkus is how many people uh are struggling with Quarkus install I don't know if I've installed it correctly or what I've just come launched the Eclipse Market Marketplace that I went and I installed it it's dead to restart that's it so after that it's come up come back to the main page where it says it is installed it keeps us pretty robust you have installed it okay now guys i got some uh security error where it says it's not an authorized software so that's did anybody else even no go ahead go ahead i got it too just go ahead yeah yeah these are prestigious development houses red hat and red hat is you can trust it they should be ashamed though All right, guys. So now what we will do once you have Eclipse, I'll show you how to find a new project or create a new project. Are you guys looking on my Eclipse? Yep. At the top left hand, there is a file menu. You can click there and click at the other end new project dot dot dot pick the new project dot dot did that java project pick new project dot dot I'm able to run the application on localhost 8080. Project type should be for the Eclipse. The code Quarkus will generate an application for you. Project type should be Maven versus Gradle. I'm not sure, Kate, what you're talking about. Share your screen so I understand better. Okay. I'm at the next step. No, no, I'm not going to the next step. I'm just waiting for people to reach here before I go there. Okay. We have clicked on project and waiting. Okay, sir. Yeah. i'm not going to the next step i'm just waiting for people to reach here before i go there okay so we have clicked on project and waiting okay so yeah okay so the thing is when you go here file the project you will click on this and you will type the word quarkus yeah right are we guys all here at this stage tell me me if you are here. New Quarkus project and then project by an Eclipse project. Yes, we are there. Is everybody here? I think so. Anybody who is not, please speak up. Premji? No, not here. I don't see the Quarkus. Let me share my screen. Okay, share your screen where is it we suffering together okay all right do you see my screen now? Yes. Now this is Mac, right? Yeah. Here. Okay. At the very top, do you dot dot okay type the word quarkus here oh okay now this park is project okay now you guys all follow what i am asking you to do let me share my screen at this moment at this moment so you guys are all here at this stage anybody who is not rafiq are you here there's a project right yes i already executed the application okay so then you do this guys you go to the next step whoa i do the project name give it whatever name you want but don't put a space in the name so let's say that you call it xyz whatever you want to call it give it that name the project type should remain maven have you guys reached this place yeah that's what i wanted to know because it the project type can be maven or gradle but i'll leave it as maven ml 400 yes use default location then next you want it yes yes wants want us to click on next for people to come i have to wait for other people are we all here guys i'm stuck here maven uh project name is something and okay we're waiting anybody else who is yet to come here how are you Next or finished. Okay, so then click on next. Next. When you click on next. So let me give you an idea guys. Your artifact ID typically is your company name. Right. So in my case, I would typically put uh uh sorry not the company name the project artifact id is your project name huh so suppose you can say ml 400 hyphen i don't know my my first cloud or something like that right like that right this is your first cloud deployment group id is about who you are you notice that it is acme.org definitely not org.acne yeah it is your thing written in the reverse order your domain written in the reverse order you do that wow you know it's super tiny i can't see it okay why don't you look okay i should oh at the original okay let me look at that unfortunately i can't increase the size of this there's no way for me to do that size of this there's no way for me to do that so i'll just speak it out artifact id is the name of your project guys give whatever you want group id should be the reverse you can say com dot i don't know kate right and your class name just there's an example resource again give it with your prefix it with your group id are we all there guys are still confused uh which are the ones that we are free to choose let me walk you through your screen share your screen your screen. You're sharing your screen now, right? Okay, do one thing. Yeah, Artifact ID, this is the name of your project. Do you see group ID? The very next item there, group ID, this is the reverse of your domain. So you can say com.balaji. Assuming that that is how you want to be remembered. Now do you see class name? Once away, put it, leave the example resource, but remove org.acne and replace it with com.bology. Now this is your, you understand how Java works, right? Is the reverse domain name. And now you can leave example resource. Say now you say next here and wait. So by the way, hang on. Yeah. I'll go back. All of you, are you seeing his screen what he has done i was not able to see that corpus in my when i opened project i also share your screen i'll help you no the reason for that is go to help please help menu go to marketplace i installed it okay then you haven't restarted eclipse i believe start i reinstalled it restarted it okay just type the word quarkus I did that and I'm doing this again. You may have missed something. I'm doing this the third time actually. It might need to restart Eclipse. I did. Okay, confirm. Finish. Okay, install anyway now look at the bottom right restart now now what you will do is you'll go to the file menu so guys when feedback I'll give you Eclipse is the dominant ID between pie charm and and Eclipse and Visual Studio Code. These are the dominant IDs. You should be familiar. Go to n.com. Type the word Quark. I literally see it there. Give it a project name, whatever you want. Next. You can leave it. See, if you don't want to change it, you can leave it all like this. Yeah, group ID, company name you want to keep it org.acne or you want to change it. It's okay, leave it for the time being. Doesn't matter. This is the company name or this whole thing is the company name you want to keep it org app acne or you want to change it's okay leave it for the timing it doesn't matter this is the company name or this whole thing is the company no no no no just org.acne acne.org you can replace it with first name okay yes sir yeah and group id also that hang on oh all that yeah now yeah next and now wait here till i till i take everybody through the instructions huh okay the instructions that i gave you you can use the time to read the instruction okay this part all right okay so guys are we all here now is there anybody else Okay. This part. All right. So guys, are we all here now? Is there anybody else who needs help? Yes. Go share your screen, I'll help you. Are you sharing? Kate, are you sharing? I'm fine. I'm just waiting. Oh, you're just waiting okay yeah yeah anybody else needs help guys we are here so i'm going to click next yeah when you do next you should be on this screen right so now look at the instructions that i gave you the library that we need to select are here that i gave you the library that we need to select are here do you see this guys this is the list right and these are under these categories under web pick these four under core all you have to do is click on that double click on that right so i'll show you what i am doing i'm going to web i'm picking the first one i'm clicking on the second one i'm clicking on the rest client right and what are the other ones that i have selected some of them are essential some are not so essential rest client jackson also might as well Might as well. Four. Then I go to core. From core, I pick YAML configuration. Now let me explain what these things are. On the web, REST service I call it Jax-RS, that's the standard. REST easy is the implementation for it. Jackson is the library to deal with XML, JSON, and protocol buffer and other formats, data formats. These are famous libraries. Now, YAML is a way, these days we have moved away from property files. People believe that YAML is a better way to keep configuration information. So double-click on YAML. is a better way to give configuration information all right so double click on yaml it would just have some chance so everything is emma lasik right right now kubernetes doctor setup yeah yeah absolutely all right so guys once okay okay i think this is out of charge how did you come to this new caucus project i was in the previous page where you helped me edit here your screen so i was here where we left uh editing next okay yes you are here so click okay yours is slightly different maybe it has changed since then click on the web under web click on rest easy if you look at my documentation double click here double uh double click okay the next one yes okay then go to rest client yeah okay then go to core on the first bar um okay click on yaml configuration then follow the instructions i've given a whole list in that doc. Got it. Okay. Got it. Sure. Thanks. So guys, you are here. At the end of it, now I'm not going to do all of it, but follow this. Make sure that all of these are selected. Follow the instructions and do this. Let me know when you are here double check so they end up in the third column for selected right exactly rightmost column those needs to be selected is it all the list whatever that in the yeah yeah the list that i've given i'll tell you you don't need all of it immediately if you're going to do an enterprise class deployment these things matter so rest is jack cyrus is a no-brainer right jackson is a no-brainer yeah yaml for obvious reasons kubernetes we are talking about google Cloud, we need Kubernetes. Right? A small drive, we need health. This is the health monitoring. Like keeping track, heartbeats and so forth. What is the container image GIMP? So let me explain the GIMP. So pay attention guys, before you do the installation. These days, one of the more efficient ways to deploy containers is called jip it has really simplified it's a very interesting open source project by the way it was started by google itself jip and open source so it is the new way of deploying containers so you include that metrics what are metrics it keeps track of the performance of your application under load you know in production then open tracing tracing helps you get a sense of what what is causing what in the system that's what it is so guys please do go and select all of this Let me know when you have selected all these extensions. All this is gonna help us out. Like what will we be using this for? Okay, let me go from the beginning. See REST service in Java is standardized by JAXA. So that explains the first selection. What is that service? What is a REST service? Yeah. Okay. See, when you interact with anything on the internet, you have two ways of interacting with it. You can interact with it. One second. I'm getting a message. So you can interact with it using just visiting a web page, right? So you type a URL, you visit a web page. But when programs, you know, reach out to each other on the internet, there is a list less beautiful or decorated way of doing it much more programmatic you can again expose these so-called endpoints which have very much like a url but when you invoke that you will get data back typically those are called rest endpoints for very simplicity sake think that these are sort of simplified web pages or endpoints that give you web pages. And take it as an assignment. Learn about what is REST. On a YouTube, just watch a video of what is REST. Because it's at the heart of taking things to production so here what we are doing with all this eclipse and caucus how is this going to help us are we going to create like a connection between our project and yeah see what we are going towards is remember this is literally the practical part of the monday session mond session, what did I say? That you have your application, you have your model. It is all right to do model in Python, but once the model is built, what do you do? You want to take it to production. You can do it the way, you know, just Python gives you this flask and fast API and such ways of doing it. But you can use that. The other way i wanted to show is using java because it's more high performance so you need to take your application and deploy it to the cloud so you deploy it that is the kubernetes part right we created a kubernetes cluster then comes the question in the k cluster, what do you deploy? The answer to that is a rest service. Your application must behave like a rest service. So read up about rest service guys, if you don't know. So once we've got them all selected, do we click finish? If you have all of them selected, yes, we can finish it. So Nisarg did I ask you? Yeah, kind of. So what is the whole world, Nisarg? This is the world of taking code to production. It's the other part of the journey. How does, what does the application look? The old days used to be that you would get a binary you would install it on your desktop yeah but these days when you create applications that millions of people will hit right and access over the internet so the you can't create a dot exe or something like that what you have to create is a rest service or some sort of a you know micro service create is a rest service or some sort of a, you know, micro service. The rest is actually was the king of the hill still is the king of the hill. Though personally I am an inviting, we have moved over to GRPC and websockets. Yeah. I said, that's what I wanted to ask. Like, so should we select the last one? The GRPC? If you are familiar with GRPC by all means, but in this tutorial, I won't take you through it oh i can show you my code on grpc and web sockets uh for those of you who are motivated how to do it but in this tutorial i won't take you through it because you know i'm at this moment you already are seeing people are getting stretched just understanding what uh what we are doing so i won't yeah like this is the first time i'm seeing all this so for me it's like greek and latin yeah think of it nisarg as the one world of things that you really really have to know irrespective of which language you do it in python java doesn't matter these are technologies these are the core of the Most of the things that you do, you know, your maps, everything else in Google is a microservice. Even your Gmail's are run through microservices. So this is the, this process you went through is setting up a microservice? In the cloud, it will convert it. And so this is it. Oh goodness, it's quarter to 10. Asif? Yeah. Asif? the cloud it will convert it and so this is it oh goodness it's quarter to ten yeah uh uh grpc and web sockets are the next uh version of rest is it no see rest the problem is many things have come four things three things three new things first rest has a problem suppose you so i'll take an example suppose you have a library of books? And the books contain chapters and the atomic level at which you can get it is the chapters. Yeah. So suppose I ask you and the books have subjects associated with them. So I say that I should be able to on your application get books by all sorts of means. I should say subject and then this query word, or I should say, give me any book, any chapter only, which contains this particular keyword or in this language. So what happens is soon you start creating a lot of rest endpoints methods, exposing a lot of endpoints in your rest server. Problem is you will still miss out many use cases. So then one big thing that people said is that why don't we treat the server as though it is a database and we can query into it in a graphical because it's a resource, right? Root is the library, library contains books which have metadata of subjects associated with them dimension and publication date and whatnot. And they have chapters which have query. So there are so many, many ways you can access the data. It's like SQL. So let's create a SQL like language for accessing the whole thing as a resource. So that was the GraphQL movement. Very powerful. So GraphQL is the next thing that came. I mean, once GraphQL came in, REST should have faded out. But it hasn't because it has so much adoption. Then the next problem with REST is people were exchanging data as either plain text or as json strings right in and out which is inefficient so the idea was let's do a binary so if you try to do binary format then again you need a very efficient protocol in the meanwhile when they were doing binary, the HTTP to a protocol came about, right? HTTP to a protocol and this protocol buff, which is the binary format, makes it gRPC. That's all it is. It's basically very much like a rest endpoint, except that you do it over HTTP to go and you do with gRPC. Then WebSocket has an interesting thing. It changes the game differently. It says that if you make a request, you have a connection. You can keep sending requests and we can keep sending back the responses. So one request may be followed by 100 responses, for example. In REST, you don't do that. You make a request, it gets back one response, isn't it? But in WebSockets, you can make a request or you can make 100 requests and get one response. Or arbitrary many, you can make N requests and M responses. And the two can keep sending both of these in parallel. While the requester is requesting, making more and more requests, the server is, the client is and the server could be fulfilling those requests one by one and pushing the answers out right but you could be that web socket also has the ability to broadcast in other words it can broadcast the answer it's giving you to all other clients who are connected to it so it's become a connection oriented protocol then like does that connection remain open all the time yes with the possibility that it can break and so on and so forth but yeah it is a connected protocol and it is very popular for chat so the quintessential application of web sockets is chat you can create a chat in like five lines with web sockets yeah so those are the different standards that have come about. But still, see, these are all emerging new things. A lot of people use it, like in my team we use it. I can show you the code right now of an example to use it. But the basic, you know, the kindergarten of all taking applications to web and exposing it as a API is REST. to web and exposing it as a API is REST. So as if GraphQL is HTTP 2.0? You can run it on HTTP 2.0. And you should, you should. As if going back to the explanation that he gave for GraphQL and how it made REST better, the way I understood it was, in the case of REST, when things evolved, you have to go about a process of publishing it. But with GraphQL, it's a discovery process. Is that the right understanding? Right. So think of it in a different way. You're familiar with databases, right? You come from Oracle. Imagine that you have database with foreign key references, two tables, parent-child relationships, right? And they have 30, 40 columns. Now, what would be the most appropriate way to access data? SQL, isn't it? Because you can write very flexible SQL and get data, right? with where clause and so forth on the other hand every single way to access data must have an endpoint as if you can also pass you know attributes of the object parameters as the request parameter that is right you give the path params and the argument perhapsams, but still it is very limiting. Yeah, you're right. There is a limitation. So there is a combinatorial explosion. The more complex your data objects are, there's a combinatorial explosion in how many ways you can access the data. And then soon you create a rest API and your saga file looks like the swagger API. You have to keep scrolling up and down. And that is terrible. So the right way to do that is to do GraphQL. Make GraphQL queries. So research these topics guys. I won't go into those things because obviously as you can see here our primary focus is deep learning and many people are hardly not yet familiar with web services so we'll stick to the basics this whole tutorial is created with the basics in mind but this much basics that you all have to pick up guys if you want to survive and you said take this rest service thing very seriously. Okay. Yeah, I'm just trying to understand where, how, like where it stands in the stack and how. You'll see that immediately. So hold on. Now you're about to get done. This long journey is about to finish. So guys, you're all at this level, at this level here, right? If you hit finish and I encourage you to hit finish, I won't because I have the application running here. Hit finish. What will happen in Eclipse is a project will get created. Right? And you can navigate this project, you can do more things. But the one thing that I will tell you how to do is go into SRC main resources and you will find an application.yaml. In the application.yaml to be able to deploy this to the cloud we will add a few things but don't do that right now. At this moment just finish it finish your application. After finishing it opened up the Eclipse IDE ide yes of course you are finishing within the eclipse id itself right okay but where do i find the project share your screen please my screen is not responding after clicking on application.dmi My screen is not responding after clicking on application. Yeah, so yeah, let me see. After I hit finish, this is what came up. That is all right. Get rid of the welcome. You know the welcome thing next to it? The cross. You forget it. You have the project, MLP. Do you see on the left-hand side the project? Open it. That is it. Your project is ready now. Okay. All right. Mm-hmm. that is it your project is ready now all right good so now leave that now go to the command shell guys go to your command line now i'll share the screen yeah this project is so there's an observation that i'm making which I think is okay. Seems like everybody's getting it. There are two errors and two warnings, right? That seems to be. That is all. You can ignore those. Asif, should we go to the cloud, Google Cloud SDK shell or command, like Windows command? Just your Windows command line, enter the directory. I see here is what I'm doing. So here's the thing. This is your project that got created ML 400 cloud, right? Right click on it and see, remember the location it is in. You should remember what location it is in. You copy this location, right? Once you have copied the location, go to your command shell, Windows, Mac, Linux, whatever it is, you can go to that directory right you can go to that directory i'm sorry you will go to that directory in my case it is ml 400 cloud right see do you notice that here is my project and inside my project i will see all these files that i created can you all please go through the command line to this directory uh asif can you show that property again like right click what did you do right click on your project hang on let me do this again just right click on your project click, go to the properties thing at the bottom. Okay. And then look at the location in the dialog, look at the location. It tells you where on your machine you installed it because you forgot. You can always go and remember where your files are by copying this. All right. Yeah, so if you click on that icon next to it, it should open a terminal to and it'll take you there. Yeah, I don't know, but in my case Linux, I never use that. So, okay, here it is. But the point is not to use in the Explorer, but to go through the command line. Okay. That, okay. I'm in the car, okay. So go to that directory, guys. Let me do this. See files like this in that directory. Let me know when you have reached it. All of you. I've reached it. of you have reached it you have all reached it really slow on the last generation of the project i'm sorry what did you say kate last generation oh it's it's crawling along on the last step of creating the project okay i'll wait see if i can close something else. Guys, today we'll stop at this. Let's run this. I want to show you your successful project. I'll see if I do that out on Monday or something like this. I see some of the folders that you have when you listed are not there in mine. I'm kind of- They'll get created in a little while. Okay. So you want us to run that dot slash mvnw? Yes, run that and all these other folders will get created. We need to run that line? That is correct. If you have reached this folder, the last step you need to do is just this. Run this thing. Now I'll tell you something to do is just this. Run this thing. Now I'll tell you guys something cute that you can do. Now I'm seeing all these files like as in your screen. Now I run it, is it? That is right. All you have to do is run this, you know, this is it. Do you see this? You can run this command from the command line. It says it's not recognized. What is not recognized? For Windows, is the command different or syntax different? Look for that file there on your machine, mvnw. In your case, it will be called mvnw.cmd. Right, yes. And get rid of the forward slash. Windows people don't use forward slash. Just do mvnw in your machine, compile, dev. mvnw.cmd, right? You can do the dot CMD, but it's not really necessary. I think if you just do MVNW space compile space, Quarkus colon dev on Windows, it should work. Try it out and let me know. Yeah, that works. When you do that, you should see something. So see what happens when I do this. A lot of downloads. Yeah, first time. Check theava home variable in your environment to match the location of your java installation oh goodness your java home is not set okay guys you really are entering the java world for the first time we'll do that now why don't you share your screen okay by the way hold on guys so guys do you let me first help everybody else so guys when you run this after a lot of downloads you'll see something like this you won't see this this is something i added a banner basically what the banner says support vectors right so i'll just show you how i created the banner. It's very simple. I'll cancel here. In your SRC main resource, do you see this banner? There is a file in which I put the banner. And so what happens is that in the application YAML, I've registered the banner. I've just said banner is equal to this file. Do you see this this is just a cute thing you don't have to do it but i tend to put custom banners into all my applications so it is there but other than this you should see everything else your application will be running when your application is running when you see this line you know listening on do you see this line listening on this listening on. Do you see this line listening on this? When you see this, it means that your application is running. Have you guys all reached this point? Not yet. Lot of errors. I got an error. I see something to do with SSL certificate problem and curl failed to verify that legitimacy of the server. What if you share your screen yes so like java home is not set up yeah you have to set guys this is one of those things let me explain what it is one second let me explain it first to everyone so guys in every machine there is a environment variable called java home if it is not set sorry if it is not set the way hang on let me make it do you see when i do echo dollar java home on linux and in mac both of these it should resolve to something if it does not resolve to anything it means your java home is not yet set so what is the way to set the java home first i will tell you the solution for window i mean for unix based systems how do how do i do it you go here and then you can say if you just get for the word java home uh profile no a profile no my java home is set somewhere okay i'll tell you guys how to do it pwd if you do java minus version you know so the version is correct. So your Java is installed somewhere, right? So suppose this is the place where your Java is installed. What you do is you will open, based on which operating system you are on, you'll open the file, let's say the bash rc file. Oh, sorry. Bash rc file. You'll open it in whatever your favorite editor is and you will go down to your editor typically go down to the so you see that i put a lot of aliases and other things here somewhere at the bottom go down and then put the sentence go down and then put the sentence export java home is equal to now you will put the value so in this particular case it is paste this this is for unix based systems okay guys so put this sentence there no export java home is equal to this. Now, anybody with a Mac or Linux needs further instruction, tell me. I'm going to move to Windows now. So see, in my case, Java home is set. So that's not the problem. So I'll wait till you finish this, then we can look at mine. So Harini, why don't you share your screen now? I'll do it for Windows people. Now, where is your java installed do you remember it it is c colon java 11. so you go again to your environment variables do you remember how to go to environment variables go to your explorer explorer okay click on my computer on this pc or something whatever this windows every version it changes right click on it please right click on this pc properties yes to properties all of you please follow through with this advanced system setting so by now guys learn these basic things how to set up environment variables etc these are developer skills now you will go in the system variable you'll add a new one click on in capital letters jVA underscore HOME. In the variable value, you'll say C slash JDK hyphen 11. That is not the way it is. It is case sensitive. In your directory it is yes. Hyphen 11. OK, say OK. So in other people's machine guys, wherever it is, you need an environment variable. Now do you see that environment variable here, Java home in the list, in the lower list system variables, it is alphabetical. So you have to look at by J. It is up. Yeah. Yeah. So guys, are we all seeing it? What to do on Windows? Anybody who needs help on windows guys all right those of you on other operating systems share your screen if you're having problem I just say okay sir yes open a new command shell new command cell ignore the one that you had open a new one enter that directory wherever your code is whenever Enter the directory, wherever your code is, wherever your project is. Very good. This is good. Now let's enter the directory. Very good. Good. Now we give the same command, mvnw. Space compile. Quarkus colon dev. Quarkus colon dev Quarkus colon dev colon colon not hyphen colon dev it enter good it's Good. It will work. It's metronome. Praveen, are you there? Yes, Asim. Anil, how about you? Are you there? Yes. I am running on local auth, Asim, if it's running now. Yes, it is running right now. Yeah, okay. You guys are all able to see. Hello, hello kate how about you are you able to get your hello i have java 11 from way back in our big data days the weird thing for me is that my project it says a number of megabytes out of 530 megabytes and it keeps slipping back down in size you know from 300 and then back to 192 so it seems like it's trying to run uphill to 530 megabytes but it keeps slipping back down the hill it's kind of weird yeah you know generating walker's project yeah so hang on all of you just wait a minute now hang on all of you just wait a minute now can you please uh visit localhost colon in a new browser tab yeah what's colon 8080 so what should we see no no it's localhost localhost what does localhost. What does localhost stand for Harini, do you know? No, no sir. It is your machine, your own machine, laptop or whatever. 8080. 8080 is the port. Okay. So it is like, you know, you have a train station, you have a station, right? You reach some station like you reach Delhi, you reach Calcutta, you reach somewhere, right? You reach Fremont. So in the world of computer, it's exactly the same. Every machine is like a station. So to access whenever a train comes, you need to know which machine, which station and which platform. The equivalent of platform number in web is the port. So you're saying on local host machine station, go to the 8080 platform effectively. That's the meaning of it. Hit enter. Yes. So everything is running. If you see this page guys, it means things are running. Now go back to your URL and put slash hello after 8080 ah no you did yeah at the end of it put slash hello slash forward slash forward slash forward slash hello forward slash. Hello. Just rest easy. That's it. It's all working in your local machine. It's working. Today, we will stop here. We'll make it work locally. We are very, very close to taking it to the cloud and we will do that next time. If you guys get a chance over the next few days, try to follow the steps on your own. Otherwise, we will certainly do it on Monday. Who else is stuck? Let's- I see, I have something else that's coming up with a call error. If you can take a look and give some- Open your screen. Yeah. Sharing. Just top three. Thank you, sir. Ah, good. Harini, but become familiar with the command line and these things you need to it's a gap so should i make the screen larger or you can read i can see it i have a 15 screen everything looks huge so this is where the error came up as if you see uh where is it where is it? No, that is all right. Keep going down. FrameJIT compile caused by, hang on, let me read it. Could not find a load main class Maven wrapper. So your Maven isn't screwed. Maven isn't screwed up state. Oh, okay, guys. What do you think is the problem? On your machine, we need to install Maven. So that is something else I should tell people to do. So Maven would have come with what? Like which installation would have brought Maven in? Typically. But you see, it should have that, right? Yeah. Just do MVN on your command line mvn mbn and just say uh minus help and that's yeah or he just hit enter here no there's no maybe okay so that's the reason what is happening is you curl filter verify legitimacy which is therefore could not establish a secure more about the situation okay forget about this go to the maven site maven.apache.org from our browser right yeah i see if i got to the point where okay okay actually you don't have to do that let me show you an alternative way bring your eclipse bring up your go to your eclipse so this is a this is a better way but I didn't want to get you guys into that right click on your project okay right click on your project do you see run as run as now at the bottom you see running configurations okay and pick Quarkus applications at the bottom this one okay yeah when you have clicked on it now now hit the new button, which is at the top. Just double click on it. See what happens. Yeah, you are doing that. So now you're doing this project. Just say run. So this is the IDE version of the command line thing that we did a moment ago. Maximize your screen good maximize your console itself so that the full full screen is taken by the console double click on the console here yeah yeah let's see what's happening yes it's all working now happens is, so I'll tell you what the problem is happening. On your host machine, the Maven is not properly set up. Let's keep it for later. But from within Eclipse, you can run it like this. But where would the problem have started? When I installed Eclipse or when I installed JDK? I don't know when it would have happened. See, Maven is something we install separately. I'll add instructions to install Maven. We can do that right now. I can show you, but before we do that, copy that link http://localhost.at.at at the bottom, at the very bottom, third line from the bottom. Copy that and then write more sentence listening on. Where is it? i'm not following this one oh yeah please copy and put it in a browser okay it's running now put slash hello okay it's running now put slash hello good yeah so now we'll fix the maven so go to the maven site you're on what mac or something right it's a mac yeah so uh just say install. Download, install, install, whatever. I'll try the download so that I pick the correct one, right? Yeah. Okay. I will troubleshoot this then. I see. I need to figure out the Mac one, right? Yeah. And see, it's very simple. Maven is very easy. Just unzip it wherever. And then after that, set your MVN home to that. The other way you can do that is go back please let's let's look at the by the install option directly which one are you talking about please go back to the previous page okay do you see the use install install yeah click on them yeah so follow the steps this is it. So you'll follow these steps. All right, I'll do that. Okay. This is it. So generally, it's a good idea. So guys, Maven is a project building tool. It makes your life very easy. And you want to always use the latest version of Maven. So every few months, visit the Maven site and replace whatever you have with the latest. Is Maven something like replace whatever you have with the latest. Is Maven something like a Makefile? Yes. Let's put it this way. Um, Makefile and Maven are like putting a matchstick next to the sun. So I'm not following that analogy now. Imagine putting a little candle and they both do the same thing. Makefile help you build your code. Maven helps you build your code. But the power of Maven is way, way, way more. The whole world is standardized on Maven Gradle and its derivatives, Gradle and so forth. The last I used a Makefile was 96. Those were the CCc plus plus make files yeah in unix yeah yeah i still use that for cc plus plus code in fortran code yeah all right guys so at this moment anybody else needs help are we all able to see the hello run? Because it's a long journey, but are you all able to run this app locally? I'm pretty sure once it finishes. Okay. Rafiq, how about you, were you able to run? Yes, yes. Anil, were you able to run? Ah, yes. Okay, Arithya, were you able to run? Arithya is probably falling asleep. Balaji? Yes, I got the hello. You all got it. Shiva? Yes, I was able to run it successfully. So guys, it's a milestone. I was using IntelliJ instead of Eclipse, but that's fine. I mean, if you're using Intelli using intellijms you're already savvy you knew all of this stuff isn't it yeah kind of yeah yeah it's the same asset with intellij as similar to eclipse very similar yeah very few but more advanced so one more thing guys if you take screenshots and do that thing for intellij and give me the notes i'll add it for the benefit of everyone sure yeah um so guys i'll summarize what we learned today we learned how to create a cluster in the cloud isn't it a kubernetes cluster you will need what is kubernetes we talked about it in the monday session it is the puppet it's the puppet master and the containers are the puppets that it plays around with. Our applications are in the puppets, are in the containers, Docker container and Kubernetes is the one that manages it and manages it very well. Google runs planet scale applications with hundreds of millions of hits every day using Kubernetes and container technology. It is the most robust technology that we know of at this moment. So what you have learned so far in this lab is something very, very significant guys. Don't think that this is just yet another lab. See, if you didn't do auto-encoder or something, it's okay. You missed one topic. But if you don't know Kubernetes, you pretty much are not there in the 21st century as far as technology is concerned. Learn about it, learn about containers, learn about Kubernetes. I have taken you this far we will next time we will deploy this application that we built locally we will deploy it in kubernetes but in the meanwhile read up on kubernetes read up on docker make yourself familiar and those instructions that i have given you Try to follow through the rest of it. I will explain it to you guys clearly on Monday and take you forward. And by the way, did you guys find this thing useful or was it too frustrating and you would rather forget about it? I think it's critical. You know, parts of it are frustrating. I predict once I'm not doing Zoom that my computer will have enough bandwidth to finish what it's trying to do i said we need to stop the cluster right kubernetes stop it now sir you have to get rid of the cluster We have to get rid of the cluster. I think, from a practical perspective, what we're going to lose right now by leaving the cluster there in a shutdown state is the cost of the storage. You already reduced to 30 GB. It'll be in cents. Which is not, it is in cents. That's true. But if you want to totally not pay any money, you have to get rid of it i'll spend some pennies yeah so okay you have to leave it so i just leave it like this still and end it or now see in my see it depends you know i keep clusters running because you need it all the time i am busy doing that work so you can leave it rather you make your company pay the bills i'm not if the bill goes over you you have to pay us people will chase you People will chase you. Yeah. So be careful guys. Sometimes I know that people get, oh, you know, GPUs, oh, you know, I really need this instance of this high compute. And they feel very excited that they have a machine that they could never have had otherwise. And before you know it, they're slapped with a $4,000, $5,000 bill bill so now google has smartened up it will actually not authorize you big instances you have to literally put in a ticket get the authorization give a reason why you need big instances and then they'll give you big instances with lots of gpu so just to give you an example we run the compute that is running. In fact, it has 1,000 cores, the big data computation we are running. So that sort of cluster you cannot create just by going to the menu and pulling down. Two, three, etc. is fine, but 1,000 cores, you need you need to have a direct private relationship with google come again yeah a quick question so we just connected the g cloud system right we just leave it as it is few dollars are census okay uh those four systems for cpu and 30 gb we don't need to do anything with it right we just let it run it's a few dollars so just stop it you'll pay for storage that's all you can just delete it i just deleting i'm it now. Yeah, I think it's good. Yeah, one thing is once you have the instructions, you can keep recreating it. So don't worry. But yeah. What do you do with just, I mean, how do you stop it instead of deleting? Oh, hang on. The way you do that, actually I don't stop ever. So I don't know. I have to figure it out. There has to be a way to do it anybody remembers how to do that there must be some view and detail all possible actions or we create clusters no i think in kubernetes you can't uh stop it like compute engine you can stop it but not the cluster kubernetes clusters yeah no no how do you stop the compute engine uh for compute engine you How do you stop the compute engine? For compute engine, you have to go to the compute engine and then select the checkbox and then you can stop it. There's one thing you could do. See behind it are VM instances and you see your VM instances here? You're not sharing the screen. Oh, I'm not sharing my screen. So what you can do, I think, see, do you see this? This is part of the cluster so it won't let you stop it. Yeah, it won't let us stop this. I think Kubernetes you can't. Yeah, because if it detects that it is not active, it will spin a new one because of the auto healing and yeah you can't stop it i think so i mean from a practice i haven't left one running but just thinking logically we will end up paying for both network as well as storage because that's what we're really consuming by leaving the storage cpu and these things we are paying by the hour these instances yeah this one is by the hour by the hour so you have to look at the price calculator see if you go to the price calculator gct price 10 cents per hour so how much is it for instance per hour so how much is it for instance 10 cents so 30 cents an hour it depends upon the configuration what is yeah yeah yeah depends on cloud calculator if you go to the google cloud calculator you can then do that uh kubernetes engine right total number of nodes across all three. We have, oh, total number of nodes is three. Right. Number of zonal clusters. Nodes is 12, Asif, I think. Number of nodes. Three clusters, right? Not three clusters, three instances, each with four cores. Okay. What are these? Cloud platform. This is it. Machine family was general purpose. Yeah, it was general purpose. N1 is the one that we chose. And here we go. You can go and pick. This is the one that I picked. is it data center data center was West US West one committed usage average number of hours each node is running so this is it I do estimate and and so you will come up with the estimate of 437 per month right and you can ask for sustain use discount usually you reach out to them they'll give you you're paying 20 cents an hour it is expensive isn't it guys? At this point, I mean to the question that Harini and Balaji asked and plus what's running in my mind, it makes sense to delete it because creating another five minutes. It takes five minutes. That's what it is. See, once you become confident with these instructions that I've given you, that's what you should do. Delete and create. In reality, what will happen happen is see for development, this is it. And the other thing we do actually is we run a local Kubernetes cluster so we don't pay the cloud bills that works out quite well for us. I still don't understand the calculation. It comes to five dollars a day should be one fifty dollars. I still don't get how it. It comes to $5 a day, it should be $150. I still don't get how it's $437, but yeah. Show your calculator. See, because there are three instances, what did you do? Oh, it's $0.2 per hour, right? So that's where I picked up the number. Yes. Oh, it's multi-level, okay. So it is $437 dollars isn't it oh i it's sparkless okay yeah got it and for uh we need to follow all the quarkers the whole instruction that we need to follow once we delete and restart yeah so the plastic machine you have to go through again you won't have to do everything see the console is there right google console etc you you have to go through again. You won't have to do everything. See the console is there, right? Google console, et cetera. You'll have to do very little. You just have to create a new cluster, that's all. Right, okay. But see what happens is you do all of these things when you're going to production guys. Right. Teaching you how to go to production. Going to production is always expensive business because the reliability and these things are rock solid and you're going to production now. You're learning those techniques. So go ahead and delete it, but make sure that before you come to the class on Monday, you have it back up and everything is working. That's what I would suggest. Okay. So we just go and delete it that's it or the alternative thing that we can do is we could do a session on a saturday if you guys want to just keep it running pay for three four days ten dollars or it will come to right and uh ten fifteen dollars or twenty dollars it will come to for per day it is what 20 cents 24 divided by five six dollars okay i get fifteen dollars per day process fifteen dollars a day yeah so fifteen dollars a day yeah so so fr this is wednesday Thursday, Friday, Saturday. So $45, yeah, that's a lot of money to waste. Kill it, but make sure that you can follow the instructions and do it. See guys, you learn also. These things you have to become very smooth at. And I still do this, you know, on my own, I try all, even though obviously I have a large team of 60 people and so I don't actually need to do all this because you know I have a whole staff who will take care of these things. But it's important to know how to do this. Why is it important? Because you know your team is not always, you can't disturb your team in the middle of the night right and I usually get time, quiet time only late at night, is meetings so then you have to know how to do all of these things on your own when you're doing your own development so i think so i think other option is like you can create a new google account and you get like a 300 credit oh yes for 90 days and then you can like practice it300 credit. Oh yes. For 90 days and then you can like practice it with that. Yeah, that's a very good idea guys. Yeah, so when it runs out, Google recommends that create another one and practice it again. Oh, they themselves recommended? Yes, because I've used like around like 10 accounts till now. I asked them like instead of creating like a new account and getting another 300, why don't they give us like more credit? And they said like, no, that's not their policy. If they come up with some promotion, yes, but they recommended that like, why don't you create a new account and then forever you can like keep getting that 300 so guys follow that 300 at a time now use that don't rake up a big bill so the recommendation is how the costing works.

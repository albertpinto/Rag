 So if you want to do your labs from on Colab, the first suggestion is don't create the files directly on Colab because it will get deleted. The Colab is a transient instance. In 24 hours or less, it disappears. So what you have to do is, there are two ways of doing it. One is by putting your code on Google Drive. The other is with GitHub. the other is with GitHub. GitHub is a pre- I mean GitHub or some Git repository is always preferred to manage versions of your code. It does versioning much better in Google Drive also. There's some notion of versioning but it's much richer when you do it in a proper version control system like GitHub. But today we'll start with simple Google Drive. So what you do is you go and input your code in Google Drive. So to illustrate that, let me illustrate that with an example on my desktop. So there is one bit of code. There's only one bit of code extra that you need in all your notebooks. I just noted down. Take this code and write it down. Let me know when you guys have copied this code. have you okay it's two lines of code I hope you have copied it so what we will do is let me just go and see my Google Drive and maybe I'll use that to illustrate what just happened is my desktop still shared? No. It's not. Okay. So, there is a way for me to move this entire panel, Zoom panel to the bottom. Let me see if I can. Share computer live, disable hide namesening several mutations screen sharing and share computer sound advanced portions of a screen files okay I can't make it out Okay, I can't make it out. Come again. Are you recording this? It has been recorded. So guys, what I'll do is now I'll go to my drive. Change over to support vectors. So when I go here, let me look at this. I have ML 400 here. This is what I put there for you guys. Let me go into deep learning workshop and go into something. I'll go into text. No, not text go into sorry notebooks here we go we are inside our notebooks let me take some very basic thing for example I'll go into NLP libraries or one of them is readability right here let me see what happens if I double click on it see it is asking you try to open it up with collab do you see this guys so how do you try that and see if it happens for you. We have this Google Colab. Are you seeing it on my screen, guys? Is my screen visible? Harini Patel Yes. Yes. Rajat Mittal So all you have to do is click on this. When you do that, this thing has gotten open, as you can see from here. Now here, you know, I'm adding something to the path, readability, etc. More than that, what I have to do is I have to add a code above right here. This is the bit of code that I talked about, which you should include. So copy this code, google.collab import drive. I will have to add it to the top of my system. When I add it, see what happens when I run this code. I run this code it will ask you it will say go to this link when I go to this link it will ask me to login allow then it will ask me to copy this you know this whole thing copy it and then come back here and enter it in this location this is the tricky stuff or sorry it didn't copy properly copy I'll bring it here into this box. I enter this secret key that it has generated for me. I hit enter. And when I hit enter, so what has happened is it has mounted something to the Google Drive. Let's go and see what it is. If I go to the file, if I go to the drives, you'll see my drive. Under my drive you'll find that your entire Google Drive is now here. ML 400 is here and under that is deep learning. So what I need to do is this path is now with relationship to not GitHub on my machine, on my local machine it was that. I will now change it to that value. So I'll just comment it out from my local value to sys.path.append. What is it now? Content. Can you increase the font please? Oh yes, sorry, I apologize. So what I'm doing is what used to be true for my local machine, the library, now I have to give it relative to this. So what is the relative drive? After drive comes my drive. After my drive comes ML 400. 400 comes deep learning. This is where the svlearn, you know, this particular library is sitting. So I will run this. Oops, it didn't quite like it. What just happened? Content drive from SV learning portrait. No module named, okay. So I have to install some of these modules. So that is okay, because remember you have the requirements.txt. So what you can do right after this is, and it would help for once, a pip install minus R, install minus R and what is it that we would do? We would do a quick install requirement. Let's try that now. Not open requirements.txt. Right click on requirements. It will give you the path. Yeah, if you right click on the requirement, that's a good point. Yeah. Copy path. Copy path. Yes. Thank you. the path yeah if you right click on the record that's good point yeah copy part copy part yes thank you so i don't have to pay there you go so if you do that all the necessary libraries should get installed And then our library, this is this appends our library as we learn to the path. This is a one time when you start your this thing, a collab, you should do this for that instance. Every time I want to like today I do some work get out of it again i have to do all this yes unfortunately so what you should do is you should copy paste this bit somewhere so you you have to see this much you should copy paste somewhere these are just three lines you just copy paste it somewhere so that you do it anytime you start collab from scratch right the reason for that is a collab versions disappear no yeah so you were saying about git can't we save up till here and continue yes so let's keep it for next time okay not all in a day so now you are in good shape so you can go about doing but again But again, you have to change this path here. You see this, right? You go to the link and get his very address so you can copy the path again. And in fact, I learned something from you. Copy path. I used to just manually type it in. See what happens in reality is Colab is a great place to start. It's free by pay the $10 you get a faster version. It's a great place to start. But after a little while you want your own instance and more powerful instance to run your thing. So this is it and this ran and then you know. Asif, what about the Anaconda instance? Can I just run it there? Can you run it? Yes, yes, yes. Of course you can run it in a local instance. You should actually. No, no. What I said was I couldn't install the regular Anaconda on my laptop. It just kind of failed. So I use the, I'm using- You don't need to install it. Colab comes with that. Colab comes with Python and Anaconda and all that pre-installed. Okay, I see even in the Anaconda cloud, you have all the, you know, you have the Jupiter notebook, the spider notebook, so I can do everything on that cloud itself, right? I don't have to worry about Colab. No, you don't have to do that yeah okay my drive ms deep learning workshop so let's see what is going wrong now so these are these are little things you know you'll get some little aspects that will not work for a while So let's see what I can do to make this work. Oops. It's complaining. Oh, text tag has no attribute. Okay. So this is something we knew that there is a problem. We will go back to our, remember those four lines that I asked you to comment out? Do you remember that? Yeah. Yeah. So we just need to go back and comment those four lines out. Where it is. What you do is you go to your SV learn, NLP, readability. This was the only correction I'd asked you to do. So if you double click on it, it will, it is a zip extractor, but there is a way to Text suggested third party you can do a text editor Welcome to the authorized text So you can go and these four lines commented out. So, you don't need this because that needs a future version of the library. This is true only for this particular class. So, we have to do save to drive. Once saved it to drive now you can go back to your notebook which is here and try a luck again has no attribute we'll have to reload the whole thing we'll have to remount it unfortunately Google collab already mounted it and call force remount see while we're doing that one quick thing on the content drive is a standard keyword right it's oh yes they always give you that con see what is happening is framing they're giving you a mini Ubuntu instance and they will always mount whatever you give a Google Drive in your slash content slash strike they are I mean they recommend that you should mount things there okay and from there would be whatever we named it in terms of photos that is it here okay for some reason in my case it is not picking up that so let's go run some why is it not picking up maybe we can edit it right here as we learn NLP readability yeah right here so you have it here we'll comment it out oh here it is it is commented out so what I need to do is from as we learn it is not picking up the library all, so we will do this runtime restart. So these are little things you have to do. See with collaborate it all works. You have to get used to it, number one. And secondly, like all things like, you know, it's free, sorry. It's free, but then it comes with certain limitations. But it's very convenient because it's much more powerful than your own machine. I think I'm having similar issues with the svlearn.transfer, svlearn.sublibrary is being read on the laptop. You're having some problems? Okay, I'll help you with that in a moment. Take it one second. There you go. Finally, it seems that the stars in the sky are aligned now. It is downloading some BERT and other models. There you go. See it worked, right? And likewise, you can go and play the same game with other things. For example, okay, we don't need this. We can go up this library, go back to deep learning. And this is a nuisance, you have to navigate it from here. At this moment, this Colab has a few limitations. Let's go to pre-trained. We have the ImageNet, again, open it in Colab. And let's try running the libraries here. First of all, the system part, hopefully we have already taken care of because we have our instance running. We don't need to do that. Or maybe we do. We'll find out. No module name SV learn. So what do we'll find out no module name sv learn so what do we learn we need to go back to our readability and copy the things from here from sv learn so now what happens is it it becomes boilerplate after a little while you take it you go to image net here you will introduce that edit select cut paste easily expect there is no split here okay we will run this and the second line that was there was mount mount this sorry these two these two things and you'll bring it back up here you don't need these things but for what it is worth I'm adding it here anyway so you try to run this once again it will take you through the same process you have to copy the easier way to do it like you could directly use the when we go left side and collab it says drive mount and then this thing comes up and then you just copy and paste it oh it does okay it used to not be there they must have just added that feature very nice now you don't need that and that is very good if that's true this very good name says okay import says i am using says but I think I forgot to copy one line and bring it here so obviously and now I'm doing image lift. So, it is bringing in a big model, huge models into this. And one advantage is because you're doing it in the cloud, downloading models is very fast. Do you notice how fast it went? 45 Mbps and so forth. You won't get that kind of speed locally. Now we go to the next one. There we go. Can you quickly show the top modifications that you made to the notebook so I can note that? These are the four. Line three to line eight. Awesome. Three to eight actually why don't I put it on slack so all of you have it should I put it on slack absolutely There you go. So see, here's the thing guys collab is great good thing that it is speed it these are pretty powerful or rather speedy machines they get GPU support it will usually be better than if you have an old laptop I would suggest that go and purchase for yourself the pro version you see collab You see Collab Pro. So I have the subscription to it. Things run faster with Collab Pro. There's some configurability to it. Some things are configurable. And you can even choose your, if you're used to VI or some other binding, you can use that keyboard binding. some other binding, you can use that keyboard binding. You can change the theme from light to dark to adaptive and so forth. So for example, if you do a dark theme, this is what it will become. So a little bit of configurability is there. It's not a full ID, but still pretty useful. And so here we go. Asif, just a quick question. At what point in this workshop do we have to switch to GCP? I mean, like, is there value in moving to GCP right now? I would suggest so because see, get familiar, Colab with, see, it's a little bit, you have to add these extra lines in Colab and this and that. Colab is a great experimental workbench, right? Google wants you to create new notebooks there. But the moment you do a complicated project, do you see that you have to include it in the path and you have to do this mount drive and so forth? Yeah. It's a nuisance, but you should get used to it because Google GCP, most of the time when you go and get a job nowadays, right? The companies will expect you to work in the cloud. Okay. Because these hardwares are very expensive. You know, the machine that you saw on my desktop in my office, that white elephant, it costs not $10,000. It's more like $14,000 machine. And that is just for one person doing development. By the time you get a fully configured machine, it can infect the machine that I just ordered. It's very expensive, $27,000. So most companies don't want to give those expensive machines to every developer, AI developer and so forth. So they tend to ask you to work in the cloud. Then when the cloud gets expensive, they buy machines. Okay. So use the cloud gets expensive, they buy machines. So use the cloud quite a bit. You'll get used to this. The other option is, see I today introduced Colab, right? There is a way to get out of all of these annoyances, which is to have your own Jupyter notebook in cloud. Now there is a cost associated with it. I will, maybe next weekend, next Saturday, we'll go through that process. You're talking about Jupyter Notebook in GCP? Sorry, let me just finish that. You have to be a little bit careful in GCP when you create your notebooks there because you can rake up a big bill. You're creating an instance. The more powerful the instance you take, the more expensive it is per hour so usually if you're careful and if you learn to shut down the machine then it is fine the whole month you'll rake up a bill of like $15 but if you go to sleep with the machine running next morning you'll wake up with a $50 bill so that's it yeah go ahead so that one hour you're talking about is the you know like the execution time, right? Not the time you spent editing the code, right? Unfortunately, with a Jupyter notebook, that is what it becomes. Oh, okay. So- It's running there and you're doing it. See, it's a convenience thing. So what people do, I'll tell you what I do sometimes. In my team team i recommend people have one jupiter notebook instance or the whole compute engine instance which is really low powered where the cost is in pennies per hour right so the whole month you'll break up like a 10 bill then okay have another instance which you keep shut down most of the time which is high powered most of the time, which is high powered. And which you fire up only to do executions. Okay, I understand. That's how you do it. So this, I mean, like, what is the Jupiter notebook you were talking about? Is it the notebook that you open in the GCP or you know, like that's separate? I mean in the GCP or you know like that's separate I mean the GCP notebook in the GCP if you okay Jupiter notebook what it does is you'll be forced to create a compute engine yeah basically because the VM instance now it has your data you don't have to go to get anywhere it is like a regular machine you'll'll do get checkout and your code remains and you fire up, you write your Jupyter notebook. It is basically like a laptop in the cloud. It has all the functionality. So you don't have to do this sort of things we are having to do with Collab. But the danger is, see what happens is soon we want our computations to run fast. So we all will go and allocate big. Everybody has made this mistake. In fact, you guaranteed you'll make this mistake. One day you will go and take a lot of GPUs and the cost will be $12 an hour. And you'll promise yourself that in 20 minutes, I'll shut it down because they charge you by the minute. You think you'll rake up a bill of $3, but then your family calls you for dinner, you walk out, some friend calls, and then you go and next morning you wake up, 10 hours have gone by and you have raked up $120. Yeah, yeah. I understand. That is why I'm saying that first, Kola with without its limitations, still a good place to start. Just get the pro version, you know, in the settings, go and get the pro version. Once you guys become familiar with Colab, right? Then maybe next week I'll introduce you to the, you're creating your own compute instance and so forth, because I don't want you guys to start hitting me right away after getting a big bill. So that's it. Thanks. Before we close, can you show that navigation on the left hand when you did the, going through the directory in Colab? Yeah, here it is. So what will happen is under Drive, My Drive, My Drive is unavoidable. Then your entire Google Drive will start showing up on the left. Okay. Okay. I think something unique is happening on my end. I need to figure that out. Okay. You can share your screen. Maybe after everybody is gone, you can share your screen. I can help you with that and as you notice that if you take google pro i mean collab pro things do run pretty fast you know they are running pretty fast here you'll see or as fast as it can it will never be comparable to seeing the experience on a powerful workstation, but then see powerful workstations cost like $25,000 a dollars, whereas Collab costs $10 a month. Huge difference. So now Yeah, it's running pretty fast. And the results. So how are you now? Are you up to speed? Are you able to do it? How are you? So I'm able to mount, but the ML 400 folder is not showing up on the drive i just copied it onto the google drive but it's not showing so i'm trying to you know re-mount it and check why it's doing it you have to remount it you have to say remount force mount is equal to true okay i'll just try that and get back to you all right guys so that ends today's session on uh on this topic what is the next help you guys want anybody needs any help uh primjit i think you need some one-on-one help would you like to share your screen i can help you no that's one one second uh i think i might be in the same situation as harini i probably just need to do a force remount. Yeah. Okay. Let me try that first. So are you guys finding all this? How are you liking this course so far, guys? I'll send out a survey, by the way, tonight. Is it moving at the right pace or is it moving too fast? Any feedback? Somebody needs to... Hello? I think some people, it would help to quickly go through all the directory structure I'm doing that catch up with all the files that we suddenly have for the first homework yes okay let me walk you guys so if we do it from my local machine because it is just easier quicker to navigate here so I sorry but before that, I tried to remount, but then again, it's I can't find the ml 400. Let's do one thing. Why don't you share your screen? I'll help you solve that. Whether it was benefit helpful but I think we can go faster we can go faster okay good I can go faster actually now that I think about it we don't have anybody in the audience from human social sciences usually they have difficulty understanding what variable is here everybody has some programming background isn't it how do you had some programming background All right, you're sharing your screen. Can you go up please? Now where is your mounted drive? Click on that. I can't hear you Harini in case you're saying something. I can't hear you. Yeah, okay. So I use the mount option here directly so I don't have to write code. Okay and then go to your one of your where is the code where is the ml400 this this is what the library is here but the drive but the ml400 is not here well you need to upload it now you need to first upload it to your upload is it's in the drive already show it to me that it is there yeah one second to drive to google.com yes I don't see it here I'm doing it into a different drive yes you you probably put it in some other account you may have multiple gc accounts yeah okay let me try again all right uh prentice would you you guys through the let me become the screen sharer for a moment and get you guys through. So guys, when you look at this, there is a deep learning package, a deep learning directory. It contains some basic things. Requirements.txt is meant for installing the software that is needed. You now know why we need it, right? You do pip install minus R, this thing. The hardware consideration was my notes on what hardware to buy or GCP and so forth. So this is easy. How to author markdown tips. By way this is how type 4 i showed that type first i wouldn't do that again so now the this thing the two main directories here that are relevant are three directories notebooks is where the jupiter notebooks are you should always start with notebooks the notebook is backed by a library that i wrote called sv learn backed by a library that I wrote called svlearn. Large sections of code for which you may not be ready yet, I have put into svlearn. This is the usual idea. People put Python code into libraries. So I will not go here. I'll go to the notebooks first. So the notebooks, there are so many directories of notebooks. Let me give you a tour of that idea is about Sajeevan G. As you remember, it's a UI vision data visualization framework. What does it help you do it creates your basic charts and plots and so forth, quickly in a few lines. It helps you make interactive charts and plots. So that was the Altair library. Sajeevan G. The AutoML was about automated machine learning. For example, in PyTorch, how would you do... It will load in a moment. Is it empty? Why is it empty? Okay, something fishy here. So, auto-escalon, there's something here going on. Did we unzip the file here, Bawaro? You have to unzip it, yes. You have to upload and unzip a directory version of it. Okay. Okay, so here is the auto-sklearn, right? Then you have auto... So automated machine learning is here. Datasets. This is the CIFAR example based on the famous CIFAR data set we talked about that Kate you remember that since you asked for the tour of the directory so I'm giving it here this is the CIFAR directory there's a CIFAR class and playing with the CIFAR class this is the first place where you write a neural network. By going and looking at the code. Then This is for creating widgets. NLP, this is the readability and keyword extraction and you should start with, the ImageNet, the AlexNet and the duck and the dog example. So this is it. This is the directory structure. Notebooks are where you go and play with the notebooks. And then if you want to see the libraries, understand the libraries, you go into the SV Learn. But there, the only libraries that you should try to learn is NLP, Transfer, and the datasets. Go into the libraries not yet. Go into libraries once you are much more familiar with PyTorch and deep learning. I would say that at this moment, avoid the library package. Okay. Once you become much more familiar with stuff, then we can go into the library. Then there is the text directory, which just contains five texts. Let's go to this text. Tale of Two Cities. Here it is. Is there anything else you want me to explain, Kate, or this is it? Anybody? All right. So, yeah. If you guys are quite, if you guys it does anybody else need help no see if I think I figured out what the issue was I had gone up one directory that takes you to a complete I think it's it's like a machine there right I've seen some bin and so on I couldn't understand what I get it alright guys so and Harini are you able to make progress it's actually loading so no problem I will try and if there's any issue I will get back no problem all right guys so I will stop now and I wish you all a pleasant evening

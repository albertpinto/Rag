 But Shukik isn't here yet. Okay, now I'm seeing the live stream. You are. Hey, welcome. All right, folks. All right folks, welcome once again to the Saturday paper reading, except that today is unusual. We won't be having project that sruthik did sruthik is a first-year undergraduate who came here to do a summer internship he did a very good job his task initially i thought he's a first-year undergraduate uh he's going into sophomore year obviously we should give him a simple task, but he far exceeded my expectations. He not only did the project successfully, he did it almost independently without much too much guidance from me, just needed enough hints and he got going. hints and he got going. He used his problem definition was, which I thought would be fun, is to be able to distinguish between three kinds of sounds, to be able to tell whether a sound was a barking dog, or it was a bird's chirp, or it was basically noise or a car going by or things like that or the rustling of the leaves. So he started out initially got certain level of accuracy in the first week or so which wasn't quite good but the most remarkable thing is he persisted at it and gradually he increased the accuracy to the high 90s of his classifier. He had to write a classifier. Not only did he do the classifier using one approach, he did the classifier using multiple approaches. He first rendered the audio files into spectrograms, as you would expect. Then he used a transformer, a vision transformer, to write the classifier all on his own. He didn't just use an off-the-shelf audio classifier to do that. He used that. Then once he had successfully finished that, he realized all the lessons that you learn when you do a project, namely it isn't just about the models you use. A lot has to do with whether your hardware is right or not, whether the data set is good or not. And along the way, he had a lot of struggles with the data set. He put in a Herculean effort to go get and gather the right kind of data set from various sources. The end result was two assets. He ended up creating a very good data set on this topic. And the second thing he did is he created a very successful model. That model not only did well, it actually beat as a comparison, as a benchmark, we asked him to compare it to PyTorch's audio library, PyAudio. And to his great credit, Shrutik managed to beat Pi Audio. His model did a much better classifier than Pi Audio does out of the box for this particular problem. And that all of this put together is a hallmark of a very successful project that Shrutik did. And once again, to his great credit, he is just a sophomore entering into, he's just becoming a sophomore now. He has been an undergraduate first year. He came here with practically no knowledge. In fact, what is even more remarkable is before the internship, he had never encountered data science. So when he came here, he quite literally sat down and in a marathon session, under the guidance of his uncle, Saurabh, he sat down and watched all the videos of ML 100 and 200 in a long marathon session that took lots of notes, learned a lot of things from that. And after that, he dived right into the project and did this project with great persistence, resourcefulness and success. So obviously one of the things that I'm really proud of this summer is the sheer quality of internships that people have done. summer is the sheer quality of internships that people have done. A lot of wonderful internships happen. In passing, I will just mention a few of the other internships that happened. Sonal did an internship of talking to documents. It was literally one of the projects that you will do. By the way, both this dog spark project and the project that sonal is done and the part that anasudan they were actually intended for this boot camp they were intended for people with to be done as teams and people with significant programming background and maturity but because they were single-handedly dedicated to the internship some of the projects from the boot camp I had given it to folks to do on their own. And so one of the projects that is actually a part of your internship is called Eloquent Conversation with Documents. So what Sonal did is she took a whole lot of documents in various formats, whether it is PDF or text or word or this or that, and she created a conversational interface, which a lot of people are doing. But she did a really good job of putting together the end-to-end project, getting the document pipeline in place, getting it so not just doing a small proof of concept but doing the whole thing end to end. Again, to her great credit, the third project which was Kashish and Patrick and many many people put together here, Anas and Akira and a few others did a massive project which was to listen to a hospital conversation, a consult between a physician and a patient, and from that to infer the diagnosis codes, the diagnosis to infer the procedures the physician would probably do to convert it into the standard medical format, the SOAP format, subjective, objective assessment and plan of action to do all of that. And obviously that is work in progress, but a very successful project that the team put together. And when they put it together, it wasn't that they just invoked well-known transformer APIs on the internet. They struggled quite a bit in the data gathering and asked for tremendous effort to take it to production, created entire microservices there. Kashish and Atira and Patrick, they put a tremendous amount of energy into creating the AI models properly. It needed multi-faceted talent. Anas brought talent from his data engineering quite a lot and did that. Patrick, obviously being a physician, brought a lot of medical knowledge. And obviously I think in our team, nobody is as good at prompt engineering as absolutely superhuman at prompt engineering as Patrick is it's just amazing how well he can craft specific prompts especially in the medical domain and and do things not to mention the fact that he's another person he's super super excited about the large language models and transformers. And now he's the proud owner, as you know, of a really nice water cool little machine of his own on which he trains stuff. And then Kashish came as a person who had a very little background from a practical industrial experience perspective. And likewise, Athira, and both of them, they put in fairly superhuman effort. I'm really impressed with the results of that hard work every time I interacted with them. And it was just amazing how much they persisted and made the entire medical project successful. That medical project, by the way, what it means is the good news is that they did an exceptionally good internship. Now, the part that for most of you would be interesting is now that whole medical project is part of your boot camp. It was part of the boot camp but now I've expanded the scope of it. In other words, initially I'd intended it to be of say let's a given size and now that project because we discovered many interesting things you could do along the way. The size of the project is twice that now. It's one of the projects that you will do. So again, a very successful project. Another very good internship that someone did, and I'm just enumerating the internships done this summer as the summer comes to a close, was, and by the way, along that there is Hamad. Hamad is another brilliant young fellow who single-handedly took amongst his projects is a couple of machine learning projects and many other interesting things he did. But amongst the things he did, he, as you know, support vectors has been pretty much under-resourced and it runs on a lot of volunteer help. Hammad jumped in and he made a huge contribution in setting up the network here. He got the, he literally got all the wiring for 10G. As you know, Support Vectors now has a 40g internet connection 40 gigabit internet connection to every room there are at least four typically eight independent fibers going to each of the meeting rooms so when you do your internship you'll have access to that 40 gig network that 40 gig network spills into the data center room. During the pandemic, some of it had gotten neglected. Hammad sat down and he pretty much rewired the whole place and made sure that the routers were properly working and everything was properly assigned and so on and so forth. The whole thing is humming along. We also got our storage area network, NAS, going. And the NAS is, and this is, again, for those of you who are here, you'll appreciate this. As you do the boot camp, you will have absolutely no as of this moment. So you have 200 terabytes of official space on the NAS itself, and you have another about 100 terabytes of space on secondary devices on-premise. So networking is super fast now, and thanks to Sukpal who again came and set up the firewall. And obviously Sukpal is great at building high quality machines, very very good AI servers. We now have a dedicated firewall, and this too happened this summer, and I consider it part of the overall summer internship initiative. Sukpal is again a physician who has been a surgeon for a long time and is a wonderful, wonderful healthcare informatics guru, along with Patrick. So anyone of you who needs your tummy cut in a hurry, Sukpal, from what I understand, is ready with his surgeon's knives. You can immediately shorten your tummy. But he's also terribly good with computers. In fact, at least five different computers that come into existence, servers that have come into existence this summer at support vectors, all for the purpose of this upcoming boot camp. So while contributed he also took care of the firewall and other aspects of it, so it has been all a wonderful thing, lastly, I must mention about an ass. And as did he took part in a cable competition and I believe he wasn't the leaderboard though he didn't come first he was second or something like that or somebody in the leaderboard, though he didn't come first. He was second or something like that, or somewhere in the top 10. I forget what his latest rank was by the time he formed. He started out with a very interesting problem, multimodal AI learning problem. What was amazing about Anas was his sheer persistence. The way he just sat down there and kept on at it. He brought in squeeze formers and he brought in a transducer and so on and so forth. He had all the right ideas and the data he started looking into. At the end of it, the person who got the first prize used exactly the approach that Anas used. So Anas was completely on the right track. As you know, in these leaderboards, people win or lose by decimal points, by the tiniest little bit. So the person who edged ahead of him and won the first prize used exactly his approach, but perhaps, but from what I understand, did a little bit more data manipulation and data preparation than Anas got time to. Anas got into the game a little bit late, but he used exactly the same approach, which was to use a squeeze former, a particular large language model and transformer architecture called the squeeze former. So with the squeeze former, he did an amazing, amazing job. So in some I would like to say that, in a way, there has been a bootcamp in progress throughout the summer with amazing results absolutely amazing results for all the people who did the summer internships and all these activities during the summer a tremendous tremendous amount of work and great success and in a way the boot camp is i look at this boot camp as a successor to the summer internship program at this particular moment and this internship is going to benefit from all the things that people have i mean this summer this boot camp is going to benefit from all the things that people have. I mean, this summer, this boot camp is going to benefit from all the fruits of the summer internship program. Right. So it's been most wonderful. Now, I still so we would like to do this is today we were going to start with. Shruthik's presentation, but Shruthikik isn't for some reason he seems to be delayed. So I'll instead start with the bootcamp. Let me talk about the bootcamp. But before I do that, guys, anyone else? Did I miss any other project that we did this summer? All right, so let's get started. So guys, this boot camp is part of what it started out in a way sort of a circular way of teaching that we have. Some people learn from theory first and then do the practicals. Some people learn from practicals and then do the theory. And it has been a conundrum here at Support Vectors where we emphasize both having strong mathematical and theoretical foundations in AI and having very in-depth experience. Now, both are necessary. See, if you only play with large language models and Python code, you just become a coding junkie. You don't understand why these things work. But you still produce exceptionally good results. The trouble is a lot of those results is just by reading this, the various social channels, seeing what others are doing, getting inspired by that and doing something in your own. It is a very, it's a very hacker orientation, hack your way, which is obviously a great and celebrated part in our field. So the other side of that is having very deep theoretical foundations. Not many people understand the subject very deeply, but we do emphasize that you do. But when you do go into the theory, when you go into the research papers and you study it line by line, and by study I mean steady, not just quickly browse through it, not just give it a quick read, but actually study it line by line and understand every word in it, you do get a fairly in-depth sense of the subject. The subject is moving very fast. As you know, there is not a single textbook in the market, not a single textbook in the market that is anywhere close to being considered reasonably up-to-date. All the textbooks are obsolete. It's just a question of different degrees of obsolescence. Now, obsolescence doesn't mean that they are not useful. They are still great textbooks to read from, to form background on. But having said that, having read through those textbooks, the fact has remained that all that is happening has happened pretty much in July, August that is of tremendous relevance than is there in most of the textbooks written on transformers and deep learning in the last few years. The subject is moving that fast. Given the fact that the subject is moving that fast, we have to read a lot of these research papers line by line, which we do. In fact, today was supposed to be another research paper reading, but we are not doing it. Because I've taken a break, we are going to do we are going to do project discussions. I noticed there's a hand raised. Shalini, would you like to say something? Yes, Dr. Kumar. So one of the things you mentioned was that this field is moving very quickly. So one of the things that I'm thinking about and also a lot of people are thinking about is the fact that um a lot of these uh prompt engineering tools land chain they just distribute the notebook so it's it's like you don't even have to code anymore so one of the things people are asking is that you know is is this coding ability needed or is is there some new set of skills that are coming into place even though Engineers are there are projects where Engineers go in and fix that code and rewrite them I just want to know your thoughts and ideas on where we'll be where we're headed in the sense that you know engineers don't even need to write the code but they need to prompt correctly but also in the problems like um you need the right data you need several other things and different tools work differently obviously um so i just kind of wanted to get your gauge on where you think this field is headed. This is a great question, Shani. Let me answer it two ways. See, in software engineering, in computer science, some things last a lot longer than others. So, for example, it is an old piece of wisdom that people learn the hard way, is that data outlifts the applications that produce the data. So, for example, long ago when I worked, I had my short stint at NASA, we had data spanning decades, but those applications, the software applications that produce the data quite often will be defunct. But the data remains. So if you look at it, data and manipulating data, storing data, handling data, those are longer lived skills than any one particular software library. Over the years, when I came to graduate school, we did a lot of our programming of what is today called all the statistical models we used to do. Obviously, transformers didn't exist, but all the things like linear regression, etc. As you know, they have a couple of hundred years of history. They existed. existed, we did that in Fortran. Then C and C++, I still remember that C++, you would frown upon and say, will it be fast enough to do our work? Today, nobody asks that question. But even at C, we used to frown upon and think that Fortran is the one way to go. Not many people know that those Fortran libraries, the C libraries, are still underpinning. PyTorch and TensorFlow at the foundation are written in C and C++ and they are backed by and a lot of the things are still backed by Fortran C, C++. But on top of it new layers came, first came you know the SAS and the Matplot So I mean, not Mac, but what is it called? Maclib? Mac. Yes, so all of those libraries that came, they were actually sitting upon LINPACK, LAPACK, BLAST, ATLAS, FORTRAN, and C libraries. Then came R and SAS and Python, and these are all layers on top of those, increasingly. So that is one aspect to remember, that these languages come and go. The hard work that has been done remains, but more to your question, which is more topical today, people are releasing the code and a lot of the people who, you know, the hacker community is essentially starting with those notebooks and making adaptations and modifications to it. So what's going to happen to the programming discipline? I believe that we are in the post-LLM world now, which means that all the programming languages would have to be rethought. The fact that today codecs are, you know, copilot and all of these have emerged, and now there is a LAMA coder too, have emerged, just goes to show that if large language models can generate most of the code or from our english language description or as somebody aptly put 2023 is the year when english became a programming language it asks another question in the post llm world shouldn't we rethink all programming languages from scratch and come up with AI-aware or LLM-aware or LLM-optimized programming languages? There are efforts, I believe, to do things like that. But having said that, we shouldn't forget that programming became dominant in the field because it was a headache. You had to instruct the computers. The computers were dumb and you had to instruct it in very precise ways. Now with coming of AI and in such impressive power, that dumbness has been mitigated. It hasn't quite gone, but it has been mitigated. So programming in itself will not be so dominant. What is likely to happen is programming is going to be a part of computer science, which is why I emphasize that theory. See, the math behind computer science, this artificial intelligence is deeper, it's very deep. And so when you make a breakthrough now in your thinking, in your conceptually, to go from that new neural architecture you thought of to a realization, to an implementation in code will be a shorter path. You don't have to be a programmer with 20 years experience to do it. You can very easily do it. And I believe that is the world we are entering where all of these things will become much, much easier to implement when you have the idea. However, much of computer science, like every other field, every other field is more about thinking and discovery and research. And I think computer science will also become more about thinking and discovery and research. I don't know if that answers your question. You know, it does. Yeah, I think the response you provided was intensely deep but if you don't mind I do have a follow-up question as well yeah so when you say so um it like you know for now we've been looking into rest programming people have compared uh Claude 2 with llama with um GPT-4 apparently GPT-4. Apparently, GPT-5 is released to some companies. So there is just a variety of people putting in just a variety of programs out there that claim to be doing things. And there are also engineers that are fixing it. So this is kind of where the industry is at right now. But also, I think, you know, we're looking at bigger world problems. I know once you once you said, you know, GPT-4 can't. I'm not sure if you said it or somebody said it can't solve world hunger or something like that. But are we headed in that direction where, you know, those people didn't have programming abilities, they didn't know how to create apps? Do you think we're headed in that direction? Because right now it feels, it seems a little murky because, yes, people with engineering degrees are hired into these companies, but also it's people who have actually lived lives, who have ideas. So I hope my question is clear. What I'm saying is that we're- What you're saying is, what exactly is an AI engineer? Is it a person with a traditional software engineering degree? Because a lot of people are now, the whole thing has gotten democratized. A lot more people are able to engage with air, and I believe that's a good thing. See computer science in my view got hijacked. If you go to the university, you'll realize that at least at the graduate school level nobody is teaching your program. It is an implicit thing. They teach you actual computer science subjects. Right. You think about the subject like you would think about mechanical engineering or physics or anything else, or mathematics. But when you come into the industry, it was dominated. It became almost synonymous with programmers. And I think it is a good thing that computers are less dumb. So programming, the dominance of programming is fading. Or as somebody aptly put, English has become the programming language. People are, so the democratization of these AI throughout the world is an amazing thing. That's a very positive thing. The second great positive is, let us get back and focus on the theoretical core the actual deep ideas in the subject let it not be about you know cuteness of programming languages right we need to rethink the programming languages in the world of llms that will happen and i believe that programming as a dominant force in computer science will fade. It will become one of the things, you know, when you're a surgeon, you don't make a big deal of using the stethoscope. Yes, you need to learn how to use the stethoscope to listen to people's chest and other things, murmurs. But you don't necessarily make a tremendous deal out of it. A doctor is much more than a guy who can use the stethoscope. Likewise, a computer scientist or an AI engineer should be much more than the guy who can write some code. And on the whole, it's a positive thing. And also the fact that the field is opening up to everyone, because computers are not so dumb anymore. Everybody can talk to them. That's, I think, a very liberating, very, very liberating thing and it will have, as you said, enormous economic consequences. Now, today, I hear with multiple factors being implicated, for example, there is now fiber optics going to Africa, There's a huge resurgence, there's a huge practically boom out there. And programmers are coming up in Nigeria and Nairobi. I mean all of this Kenya and all of these countries, they are flush with new generation programmers and they are able to do programming just as good as the guys sitting here in Silicon Valley. How much more wonderful can it get? That's really a positive thing. And the barrier is becoming lower. Programming languages have gotten easier. Python is dead simple. But now you don't even need that. You can use a large language model to generate Python for you. So the world is changing and people are able to use AI. And I mean, I would imagine that a lot of new things will happen with all of this AI now and solve some of the harder problems. All right guys, so with that I will move on to our project. A little bit about the project guys. The project starts sharply on September 9th at 10 a.m. We won't wait because it's a packed day. It's a really packed day. Now you can attend it remotely, you can attend it in person. The only thing that is needed is that you choose your teams quickly and you start with all the right prerequisites early on, which is, think of today as a soft start for the project. What do I mean by a soft start? You can actually start getting ready, making sure your laptop is in good shape, it has the right libraries that your team has formed, and you have balanced the team out, made sure that all the skills are present. So I'll talk about the skills needed in the team. So first action item of business, guys, if you haven't formed your team, please do so immediately and when you form your team please inform Patrick. Patrick is the one coordinating all the team formations. So please let Patrick know that these are the teams. Now I have received information on seven teams. I haven't received the names for those teams so I came up with some tentative names which i will show you now on my screen in a moment please let me know if you can see my screen yes we can see your screen yes so the groups are uh these are the groups names and these are tentative names i gave i noticed that some of the names have changed now. If you don't name your group, I will end up putting you in a name group. So one of them is kiosk theorists. This was the lips group. One is clouds. This is a Srinath and Athira's group. I call it she this is tentative, of course, you can change in groups name. One is Goodfellows in honor of Jan Goodfellow. So I'll have to remember who are the guys in the Goodfellows, but I think it's just a name at this moment. One was Gradient Descenders. Then one was the Julia Set. And one was Thoughtful Robots. So I believe Julia S has got renamed to um the tensor titans and they have posted a mascot of a bunch of people wearing astro astronaut suits no i don't believe that's us i I think, you know, we're with Dilip. So if Dilip called it the chaos theorist, then that's the group with me, Moushmi, Kashish. Oh, Dilip is in your group. No, no, no. I'll kick him out. One group cannot be too powerful. No, you have to be aware Dilip is a champion coder. So your group is already quite strong. I'll have to kick him out. Kick him to another group. Oh, no, we're actually kicking him out. We actually like him. Yeah, yeah, really. We are going to put him in another group. Because, see, guys, here's the thing. The groups have to be balanced. Otherwise, you guys will have a tremendous lead over everybody else. What's Otherwise, you guys will have a tremendous lead over everybody. I see. Was it? You will take DILIP. No, you guys are also strong coders. I have to put DILIP in another group. So, so guys, here's the thing. The teams are very powerful. The ones that are forming. So, you posted, you posted. So wait, we can't have DILIP. This is, I'm different. I'll show you how the teams are looking right now you can tell me uh patrick i think i i our direct message uh yeah you sent it to me on the direct message yeah let me get that so you just updated it okay they posted it to slack oh man yeah people are still changing their minds oh people are changing their minds guys you have to you have to at some point stop horse trading we didn't change your minds we're thinking about things to do and you just said that you're kicking the leap out of our project and you really like him this is cool this is clinical depression this is not okay okay all right all right i'll leave the live there but i'll take somebody inside so group two is now called so group one is sushinda money and uh dhwani and uh dhwani and uh arun and manish goba so you guys are one group. What name would you like to give your group? Wasserstein. Wasserstein? Okay, group one is the Wasserstein distance. Which one? Would you like to call yourself the Oppenheimer group no okay what's a staying group so this is made up of a Sushant of money Vani Arul and Manish that's that and the lip the lip Kashish, Anil, Shivani, Arunesh, Moshmi and Shani. Okay, I'll leave Dilip there. How about this? But I'll have high expectations from the group. This is the tensor of titans. Yeah, it's okay. You can have high expectations. We just want to leave Dilip there. Yeah, he's nice. We like him. Yeah. Oh, goodness. That team has become rather heavy with PhDs. All right. Group three. Kazis. Mustak and Abulakazi. Dennis. Albert. And Rapa. Sakpal. What would you like to call your group? Should I call you guys the thoughtful robots? Party. Bobby. No. Name yourself guys if anyone of you are present. Dennis, Albert, Sukpal. None of you are responding. Okay, so I'll call you guys the thoughtful robots. Or should I call you the terminators? Vaccinators. vaccinated okay guys so moving forward group four uh sarup sarup sanjay srinath is the clouds group what did you rename yourself as harini ai alchemist the what the ai alchemist oh that's good yeah people can't think of a name just use chat gpt Yeah, if people can't think of a name just use chat GPT. Okay, what does alchemist stand for? It's not alchemist. Alchemist. Like, like early chemist. Okay, alchemist. That is a good one because in your group you have. Oh, I thought Kazi would name himself the alchemist but you guys are the AI. Okay right your team name has changed to ai alchemist now and group five team five is praveen patrick oh my goodness this is another very heavy weight group amrit these are all strong coders amrit what would you like to call your group i'm really you're still there you're on mute Amrit, you're still there? You're on mute. Okay, Patrick, anyone else in this group? Patrick, Prave six, by the way, guys, one seven group, some of you are in none of the groups at this particular moment. The group six is Satyam, Abhijit, Aditya, Farhan, Junaid, Zaheer. Oh, this is heavy. One, two, three, four, five, six. Okay, it's already capped out. Aditya, what would you like to call your team? Optimus Prime. What is it? Optimus Prime Transformers. Optimus Prime Transformers. Optimus Prime is in, I think. Okay. Optimus Prime Transformers. And Group 7. What would you like to call yourself so group six see guys here's the thing uh this is getting a little hardware heavy three people have hardware experience satyam abhijit junaid they are all networks uh security security geniuses here. Farhan, are you here? Yes, I am. Asusab. Yeah, you like your team's name, Optimus Prime Transformers? Yeah, yeah, definitely. Good, good, good. By the way, okay, I'll talk to you in a little bit. It's been a while since I i'll call you and i know seven rakash sachin sonal shahnawaz hamad this team needs so sachin and sonal uh and shahnawaz and hamad and prakash okay this is a grip one anybody here who can name this team how about this i'll call them the kiosk theorists or gradient dissenters. Gradient dissenters. Okay, guys, and group eight. Those of you who remain, who remains, who is not in any one of the groups? Hmm. I'm not sure I said is that is that here is late rolling so I added him already in group 6. I don't know who else is spotting that. Oh, yeah. So one easy way is to just look at the top of the membership list at the top of the element and we'll know whose server it is yeah this is 38 yeah but if i okay so nobody no a couple of new registrations are coming in so there are two more we'll put it in just add them maybe the groups of five groups of six right so groups of yeah one two three four five one two three yeah groups of six would be preferable let's see look at the rooms one two three four five rooms obviously are completely ready uh i will empty one two uh one room there one two uh yeah one room there six rooms and i'll create another room seven room so rooms and i'll create another room seven room so it's oh group true is all remote no no no no arunesh and moshmip and charlie do you plan to be here i trust isn't it yeah i live in redwood city so it's a bit of a drive but um i plan to make some days and not the others, if that's okay. That's right. Okay. So we have about a total of nine rooms we can get ready. So we have space for nine. You guys will have. And so one of the things is if you have a team, send me your mascots because I have to print posters for your group and hang it outside your rooms. You will have your own dedicated room for three months where you can keep all your stuff. All right, guys. So that is that. So that's one. The other thing is I'm happy to announce the changing topic. So this is it. I'm just going to move this information here. Let me give this information. If you're seeing my screen. Group one, and let me post it to all of you. So all of you have it in yours. And I'll also post it to the course portal, which is the next announcement I'm going to make a great progress guys, we did that. Now I have a couple of very important significant announcements so don't run away. All right. So, all right, so I'm going to post this to the LNM 2023 LLM. All right guys, I've posted the information the quizzes and so on and so forth. So I'm happy to announce two things. First of all, the old website is completely internal so I believe it is running on 44 here. So if you're on campus and I'll make it available but as you can see those of you who have been here for a while would remember that this is your um course portal i am going to make it available today or tomorrow so you will have have access to it right and but here is a bit of news for you guys i am not going to further develop this portal anymore because we have a new course portal which on which we'll run the boot camp and I will migrate content from this to that the reason is this portal is running on a software that is more than six years old and it is nearly impossible to upgrade to the latest one so now if you go to supportvectors.ai or supportvectors.io, you will notice that there is a new portal that has come up. It is this. The webpage at this moment is very primitive, the home page. It has to be fixed, but if you go to the courses, you will, if you go to the courses, you'll notice that I'm gradually bringing the new course material here. LLM Project projects boot camp is your main course portal. It looks like this. Are you focusing my screen? And it will have a lot of activities that will have a lot of resources, references to textbook, all the papers that we studied in the neural architecture, it will have that it will also contain links to the videos to those papers of our paper reading all of those videos will be properly archived here as you can see these things are coming up we have in this boot camp you will actually have the support of about eight people from the teaching side it will be myself Chanda Harini Kate Athira will be there and some people will be in sort of a dual role. Atheera Kashish will be in sort of a dual role helping out both being students and helping out. There will also be another couple of people, Kayil. Kayil many of you are familiar with and have engaged with. She'll be here. And there is another person, Ria. So he'll also be there. So we'll have a total teaching staff of eight people assisting you. Please do that at the same time on this course portal. By the way, you can log into that. I just have to add you as a user. You will notice that I've started posting quizzes. just have to add you as a user you will notice that i have started posting quizzes i would strongly suggest that by today evening when all the quizzes are online please take the quizzes to review and get ready for the bootcamp right these are basic exercises they will get you started right and if you if you can't answer like if you get zero out of 25 the quiz, it means that you are in a bit of trouble, brush up. But if you are getting something like 50% of the questions right, you're doing pretty good. Remember, the goal is not to achieve perfection, but the goal is to get a small reality check on whether you're doing the things right or not. or not okay so this is it and you will notice that the first project is your your first project is to create a vector database i'm about to release the specs for the vector database today itself right you will it is a simple one now remember the projects will build on each other so you cannot say that i'm going to skip this week's project and start with next week's project. You cannot do next week's project till you have done this week's project. So this is something, a very important point guys. It is sequential. We'll start simply. We will first start by creating our own vector database. Just like chroma db, you will create it. Now, when I say create the database. And this is a point I want to emphasize, guys, this is not a POC world. Right. In the world of AI today, it is extraordinarily easy to do a POC. In fact, it's not even worth it. You can find the code, just by reading a Medium article or reading a GitHub page or reading a Hugging Face documentation or ChatGPT will generate your prototype code. CodeLama will do that. But the point is to create something that is production ready. We have invested, if you come here, you will notice that we have invested, Support Vectors has, for this bootcamp, invested many times whatever tuition it will get from this bootcamp. We have kept the tuition really low. Trust me, it is very low compared to the price of the hardware. There is close to $300,000 to $400,000 worth of hardware. I have to sit and do accounting. That is, at this moment now sitting in the data center. Everything is dedicated to this particular boot camp. We have spared no expense. The most high grade gauge 22 or 21 internet cabling is connecting each fiber cabling is and copper wires is connecting each of the rooms the rooms that you will have for your projects to the data center room these are 40 these are 40 gigabyte gigabit per second bandwidth cables heavyweight. Let's just say that just the cabling itself is worth a ton. And I'm not kidding. I literally mean it. One ton of high-grade cabling is now wiring the building. They're obviously, each one of you will get your own dedicated Dell PowerEdge super server with close to 100 cores, you have all the hardware and resources ready. The purpose is not to do POCs. The purpose is to build something real. My hope is that you guys will take this projects and some of you at least will build startups around it of your own, right? If you do choose to go, so think of it as an incubator. If you do do your own right if you do choose to go so think of it as an incubator if you do do your own startup you can make your presentations here your vc pictures here right now one more thing i i want to emphasize you will have to sign an intellectual property uh confidentiality clause which which means that uh whatever you do here is fine. It is yours to keep. That's the best part. Unlike incubators, which take a percentage or own your IP. We don't own your IP. It is yours, your teams. But the only confidentiality clause we require is you respect the IP and confidentiality of other teams. What will happen is as your teams move forward, a lot of you will do really good work on which you would want to do startups. As you want to do startups, you'll worry what if somebody steals those ideas or sees it and so forth. So the first thing you'll do is you'll sign a legal contract saying you will respect the confidentiality and IP protection of other teams and your team can do whatever it wants with its IP. You will build something production grade. That is one aspect. The second aspect is, and you can go, we have connections with investors. If you want, we can connect you to venture capitalists and angel investors. In the final day of the bootcamp, we are likely to invite some of them so that you make presentation of your projects if you do a good project if and only if you guys do a good project you'll get to present presented to those vcs if you are interested those angel investors if you're interested that is part number one the second part is we are now support vectors is now a full recruiting agency. What it means is those of you who are thinking of changing your jobs or getting a new job or whatever, we will give you full support in getting a high quality job. Not one of those low ball offers but a good job. In other words, you will have access to the full power of a recruiting team that has close to 25 years of recruiting experience because we are partnered with such a team you'll do that right right and our goal will of course be to get you the best job possible that you can get and uh the advantage of doing that would be that we will write a strong endorsement of you we'll stand behind you just sending your resume somewhere is one thing but having somebody vouch for it and write a strong recommendation that we absolutely know this person is good makes a lot of difference and of course you wherever you go if you do a good, you don't have to go through this, wherever you go, whenever you apply for a job, you will have a strong recommendation, a fair recommendation, whatever work you did will stand as evidence behind it. The third thing is that a creative studio is life, which means that as you do your projects, do your projects we will help you write blogs and articles on medium and youtube videos of your work so that you get visibility and it's a it's a fun thing so guys treat it as a full product development exercise you'll build a products you will market it you'll set out there right so you will be in an entrepreneurial mode you will behave as though you are doing a startup of your own. And what we are going to give you in support is full backing. Startups don't have access to this kind of hardware unless they get funded, in which case they get diluted. Imagine a startup where there is no dilution. get access to state-of-the-art hardware you get free food and you get to walk away with your ID so so yeah uh I wanted to add a few things here so first of all you mentioned uh you know videos and stuff so i will take charge of that i will help them create professional quality video and if they have any doubt they can go on my website and check okay and the other thing is uh please put my name in as a ta uh i will whatever i know with that knowledge help them jump start with their you know environment or whatever quickly set up if they want docker or they want remote machine or they want local machine i can help them out with that and so they can ping me anytime and then we can talk anybody needs any help setting up environment i can help them with that depending on their you know i can see what hardware they have so if they want to get the remote access and like that yes hey thanks for saying that oh by the way these are two great points uh so pal runs a very successful videographic company he has made his team has made videos for it's a movie studio some of the successful songs and movie with uh high like well-known actors and actresses their videography has been supal has done the videography for them made those videos so obviously you're talking about very high caliber talent here the other thing is the hardware aspect of it guys if you don't have a good machine to do this project on first of all you'll have machines here but and you will have access to those machines but it is always good to have some hardware local under your desk at home support vectors will help you get those hardware in In fact, Sukhpal is the person who can build you those hardware. Some of those hardwares will be here available for those of you who are interested for purchase on day one itself, day one of the workshop. But I would suggest that if you need hardware, instead of going to the likes of Dell's and whatnot and wasting your money there, here you can get those Hardwares at the price of the components whatever this component with a little bit tiny bit of marker uh makes those yeah so yeah whatever they have they don't really necessarily you know spend money or whatever existing hardware they have computer or whatever if they need help setting it up yes I am available we can help them out they can put their server in garage and we can put the thing out like abh remote accessing i am remote accessing my own server patrick is good so they can be anywhere in the world and they can they can still code on their rtx or whatever graphic are there yes. So guys, that is another facility. Lastly, obviously, when you come for the workshop, guys, come with the mindset that you are in a startup, right? Long hours, creative activity. I will give you guys the solution to those projects. But your expectation shouldn't be that solution is coming. So why work hard. My hope is that you will come up with solutions or products which are far better than the reference solutions that are handled at the end of it and I may choose to hand it out, not the end of every week, but to hand it out at the end of the entire book. So you'll be handicapped you won't you you can't rely on the solutions coming right away i may choose to give it out in december now even though the boot camp is 12 saturdays one last month is there for you to finish your projects most of you will have remained up with pieces to present to polish it up before you show it to others so december you'll still have access to the hardware so the boot camp is three, but access to hardware is four months, right? We hope to finish it all before obviously the holiday season starts in December. So I'll be there. You will find that you are here from 10am till whenever you can afford to be here. Some people will leave at six. Some people will stay up till midnight, but plan to be here till at least 6 p.m more likely you will have so breakfast lunch and dinner will all be served right uh when you are here you can expect all of that the food will be pretty much the same that you are used to uh every time so you'll have to make do with that and what else is there so that is that the first project will come through right away hopefully by today tomorrow by this let's say that by end of this weekend the project will be here now one thing i on the new portal unfortunately your old logins won't work i haven't yet connected it to google it will take me a little bit of time to get all of those things going see this uh learning portal lms development takes a long long time so please be a bit forgiving by the time the boot camp starts hopefully everything will be in place but things are moving a bit slow because it's a lot of work the very fact that this is up through all those complicated firewalls and you're seeing it online itself is an achievement at this moment but yes get started with that uh that is all i have to say i will give you a list of paper readings or references to brush upon before the bootcamp starts. So with that, I'll take some final questions before we start. Oh, yes, one big one big thing that Praveen mentioned, a very useful resource. Google Colab has now announced that there is a there is a tier that you can get to there's a free tier in Google Colab. There is a tier that is $10 a there's a free tier in google collab there is a tier that is ten dollars a month and now they have announced a tier that's fifty dollars a month with the fifty dollars a month tier you actually get access to a 100s right it's great for fine-tuning some of the models in fact it is possible that the first couple of uh projects you guys can do literally on using Google Colab, the higher tier. Some of you may consider using that as opposed to, I mean, if your laptop is not able to take that load. Let's see if it works out for you. That is it. So anyway, guys, so those are the hardware and the software aspects of it. One thing, guys, I must say, take the quizzes and the assignments very seriously. The projects you do as a team, you will have a room. And by the way, when you are here, this place will be secured. So some of you may choose to leave your little desktops or laptops or laptops, here go out for lunch, for walks, etc. Or just leave it here for the whole week. It is perfectly fine. You can keep coming and going throughout the week, not just the weekend. But weekends are special. Sunday is optional, right? I will be certainly here on Sunday. But if you finish your project on Saturday itself, you don't have to be here on Sunday. I don't quite expect that you'll really finish your projects on Saturday. What will happen is it will take you the whole week, five people a whole week to do it, right, because each project is a product and you're doing the full cycle of product development. Right, so that is that. There is a facility of bring your own project. A couple of the projects are whatever the team choose to do. They may choose to and that expresses their creativity. We have kept a couple of projects in the end for that, whatever you want. So any questions about the projects guys before we move on to the presentation from Shrutiq? I do. Hello? Yeah, please go ahead. I do. Hello? Yeah, please go ahead. companies and um can you can you delineate the differences you know if it were a spreadsheet like what's in a poc and what's in product development just so we can wrap our heads around it yeah i'll give you a simple example let's take an example from chemistry see when you let's say that you're in the lab and you just discovered a new compound that you believe will make better car tires, right? A new form of rubber chemistry or something and you have done a POC, you have showed that under certain load and stress conditions it's doing well, right? Convincingly well. That is a POC. To now build a car tire, vehicle tire manufacturing setup, the whole pipeline with vast amounts of chemicals and warts and dryers and everything, and the temperature, high temperature and and pressure injection systems. That is going to production. So the one is an innovation center. The other is manufacturing reliably at scale. So in software, the way it works out is you write some code. You show that the model is giving good inference. That is one thing. But what you will see in the project description is very strict performance benchmarks yeah so what you'll have to do is it will say that there is a unit test that will throw close to 100 requests a minute at you. We'll start with a soft target, 100 requests or 1,000 requests a minute. Inferences. Can you handle 1,000 inferences a minute? If your application cannot do that, then it is not done yet. So now you have to worry because you know that your GPU has limited memory. Right? Then how do you push through 1,000 inferences when a single inference is using up most of the memory in the GPU? So you'll have to worry about batching. What is a reasonable batch size it can do? Right? How do you fill the batch? How do you pipeline it? How do you make sure that you never feed more requests to the GPU, inferences to the GPU than the GPU can handle without having an out-of-memory error? Those are production issues. The other is how do you do a microservices implementation? Where is your, who is receiving the request, right? And when the request comes, who is doing the inference? For example, it would not be okay to say my inference, my UI inference server and UI are all sandwiched together into a streamlet. UI are all sandwiched together into a streamlet. So that's the gap between POC and production. You'll have to have a UI, you'll have to have a scaled out microservices layer, and then all of those requests will get to be properly pipelined to an inference endpoint which doesn't throw out of memory errors. For example, your first example, first is a vector database. I will give you data that will be close to a terabyte of data. We'll start small, a terabyte is nothing because this data center you'll see will have close to 200 terabytes of space. But we'll start with one terabyte, which means that you have to set up a database system that can handle one terabyte of data and that is able to create so when you create a vector database, you will not go and just download Chroma and say okay Chroma ChromaDB, here it is, here I come. Right? That will be five lines of code. Yeah, ChromaDB. Sorry, that's, that's probably another discussion. But yeah, sorry, please proceed. I'm sorry. The idea is to create something which hopefully is better than ChromaDB. Yes. So you'll have to create everything from scratch, as in first principles. It is basically the practical implementation of everything you learned in the NLP with transformers and the neural architecture course. You will have to implement it. Right? You will have to worry about these aspects because it is when you write all of that, when you think through all of that, that you develop the ability or the muscles to go ahead and do a successful startup on your own. See guys, my goal is to make you successful. somewhere around early next year, I'll hear that you guys have walked away with 10, 20, 30, 40 million dollars of funding. And you have a brand name and a company that people are talking about. Dr. Kumar, I have a follow up question. What you speak about POC versus product I mean it seems very trivial and obvious to you but it's not trivial and obvious to a lot of people just just letting you know that you know you probably have more uh information and experience that more than more people in the field so if there is a blog post I think that could be, you know, something that support vectors could share. But if this is detailed in depth, it needs to be outlined for people who, okay, here's a POC, and this is what production looks like. Because usually people put the production in the hands of product managers or program managers or whatever their name is in different companies. But this is an ongoing like debate and discussion in companies. So if it seems like you're very clear and methodical about it. So if there is something that you could write up that we could. You will see there is a methodical process will do you will do something called a ui design sprint the product design sprint followed by an architecture sprint and those prints will be very short like they'll be not a week long typically these things are a week long in companies but because we are on a very compacted time frame you'll see that your time here on saturday from 10 a.m till midnight is very very structured you will do a design sprint design how your interface will look you will do an architecture sprint you will come up and propose an architecture the pros and cons of it you will do the a sort of a ai model sprint in which you will be very clear in articulating your ai architecture the neural architecture and which model you'll use which you'll fine-tune why you want to do that everything so these will each of them be two and a half to three hour exercises very structured exercises so one of the things you will get grounding on is the process. In fact, one of the big takeoffs from a takeaways from this project will be this bootcamp would be what is a structured way of doing an end to end startup, AI startup. You will get a huge grounding on that and every aspect of that. It's good that you brought that up, Shalini. In fact, that is the value proposition of this bootcamp. Otherwise, what's the difference between this bootcamp and reading a few medium articles? Yeah, I don't really read medium articles. OK, so I'll leave that to the side. But thank you for being so precise precise because that was my question. And this is a question among tech companies that received several million dollars of funding. So at this moment, you know, people undervalue the importance of a good architect. What's happening in software companies is if you are a principal engineer, soon you get promoted to an architect. Architecture, really good quality architecture makes or breaks companies. And I'm just as I'm very passionate about AI machine learning, I'm very passionate about architecture and design patterns and things like that. I've sort of had the privilege and honor of building large scalescale enterprise architectures and I believe I've always regretted how undervalued good architecture is a rigorous training in architecture is it's really really underappreciated most people have not a single person who really knows what architecture is it's just developers promoted to architecture roles. And people say that, hey, whatever works is good architecture. True to that, but there's an alternative way of looking at it, designing and creating elegant architectures. And I hope that as I enter now perhaps the last two decades of my career, I would like to pass on whatever little i know or i have learned from my perspective to all of you in this space well you have somebody very strong maushmi she's i've spoken to her over several um several hours regarding her experience and what she's done and i think you know she might be the next person you pass your baton to. She seems very strong. She seems very curious and she's very kind. So I think you do have somebody in your corner who is, I'm happy in this bootcamp. Yeah. You too will become good at it. Trust me, these things are all learnable skills. And oh, yes. By the way, I noticed that she is in your team. So you have a good architect in your team. Trust me, she she's very she's she's very like, thoughtful and methodical. Like there's nothing that get past her. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, in this batch in this cohort, she's my earliest student. She joined my class student she joined my class she the first workshop she did of course she did was i believe in 2000 or 2001 at uc berkeley when i was teaching there she was a student there at that time so i believe it. She's very, she's very revolutionary. That's if I had one word for Mashmi, it's revolutionary. She's so revolutionary. I agree with that. She was the brightest student in that batch in 2001 or 2000 when I taught at UC Berkeley. She was certainly the brightest student in the class. So obviously, so now I expect even greater things from your team i expect great expectations now great so all right guys i'll wrap up with that uh is ready yeah he's he's on his he's speaking here in a couple of minutes couple of minutes so guys let's take a little break or how about um we take a 10 minute break i'll pause the recording or another we'll end this recording and when shutec is here we'll start a new recording all right guys any other questions on the project before we start guys trust me the more you more energy and drive and initiative you bring to the project, the more you'll get out of it. This can be, I mean, I know at the risk of sounding hyperbolic or exaggerated or marketing fluff, I would still say it when I say from 30 years of educational experience, you take this seriously, you will find that this is transformative. Transformative point in your career. So do please put in your best in this bootcamp.

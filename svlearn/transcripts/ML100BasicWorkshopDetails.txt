 All right guys, welcome to this workshop, Introduction to Machine Learning or Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. Now, before I get into the main topic today today I'd like to take about 15 minutes to introduce the basic format of this workshop. So we will meet every, well, your Sunday. And for Californians, some of you I notice have joined from California. For you, of course, it is Saturday late night. So we'll meet once a week at about this time. We will hold somewhere between six to eight sessions, quite likely. Each session will run anywhere from one and a half hours to, on some rare occasions, a little bit longer. We will alternate between theory sessions in which we learn about concepts and lab sessions. Lab sessions would be where we learn to write code, we will learn to analyze data and see some interesting, make some interesting predictions, do some pattern recognition and so forth. These are the things that you do in machine learning so while we do this there are a few ways or a few things to keep to be aware of first is all our sessions are recorded they will be available in the support vectors channel of youtube you are i'll invite you to go subscribe to that channel and to watch the video if you whenever you feel like reviewing it or you know if you miss something you can go watch it or if you join late you can again go and start it there each of the sessions will be live broadcast on youtube as this session is being besides that we'll have a weekly quiz that you can take just to check how how well you have understood the material we are covering at the same time we'll have a lab now in and I will give some examples every alternate week I'll walk you through the code and so forth. And then I'll leave you with a few data sets, a few homework things. It is purely up to you whether you do them or not. What I would suggest is quite upfront, you decide on your goals. There are multiple goals that people can have. For example, if you come from the humanities background, arts and humanities and social sciences background, in that case, it might be a little bit of a stretch to be able to do all of the programming assignments. So then your goal should be that you understand the theory sessions, you understand the main concepts, and you focus on making sure you understand those. And later on, you can cycle back, come back and learn about the labs, the programming, a little bit later. So in other words, you can take longer time to get to it. Or maybe you don't need to get to it. You need it because you are in some either management role or you are in marketing or in business. And what is more important for you is to understand the broad field of artificial intelligence, not so much to program it. So that is one goal. The other goal that you can have is to say no i want to be able to get started with data science i should be able to go find a job in data science now the surprisingly actually in in the past i have taken a lot of people to this workshop that you're going through past, I have taken a lot of people to this workshop that you're going through, and they have gone ahead and found jobs in data science field quite successfully, even with the amount of knowledge they picked up here. But these were people who did all the assignments, they did all the labs. The field of data science, or machine learning learning and AI as they are variously called, it's a very rich field and it has, it's a very, at this moment, an exploding field, which means that from a very practical perspective, it's a lucrative field. looking for people who can do data science, who can do artificial intelligence and so forth. And it is hard to find people. We ourselves have difficulty firing and hiring people into this field. We can find engineers easily, but it is very hard to find data scientists. So a lot of the people who are in my team, they have actually learned pretty much like you would be learning through these workshops. So I hope that gives you some indication of the potential that it has. Now Kunal will send you an invite to the Slack discussion group. Slack is an engagement or a chat kind of a system and that helps you, that's very popular in professional environments. It's not very different from WhatsApp, but it has the concept of channels and different channels onto which you can keep different bits of information. You can upload files and when you share code or examples, it gets syntax highlighted and so forth. So it's much more geared for professional work and it is very popular within the technical communities. So we will be using Slack. It's completely free. You do not have to pay. You can install it on your desktop. You can install it on your cell phones and your tablets it's quite convenient once you join slack there is a channel that we'll have dedicated only to this workshop people will be monitoring the channel so if you have questions we'll be answering that at the same time, you folks should try to answer each other's questions too. So that is one aspect. There is also a learning portal to which is at supportvictors.io. We'll send you a link to that. You can register into that portal. Once you register into the portal at Kunal loo and there is a page there will be a page for this particular workshop so all of the things the source code the solutions the data sites and also links to these video lectures will all be there in one place so if you miss something you can go there and get it so that is how we will proceed. All the announcements we'll make on the Slack channel. So that is about the administrative aspect. Thank you.

 . Good evening all. I think this quiz may have been fairly easy because more or less, nothing really out of what I covered during the two lectures. The very first one is a match the following. The question asked is to match the model with what is the most key attribute that it has. So the integrated model, basically the integration is what we do to arrive at a stationary distribution. I think this part should have been clear to most of you who attended the lectures. What we do when we do integration, it's basically we are taking difference of the series, for example, either we take a difference once or we take a difference twice, depending on how many times you need to bring in stationarity. So that is the closest to the integrated model and when I covered profit I did mention that it is one of it is the only of the different models that we covered the only one where we can have this concept of change points which means you can have a certain trend till a certain point in time and then another trend from that point onwards so we can introduce several such change points that is the key feature of one of the key features of profit i mean of course profit has many others as well and double exponential smoothing i covered in the very first lecture we have single exponential smoothing helps in doing smoothing and double exponential in bringingoothing and double exponential in bringing in trends and triple exponential in bringing in seasonality. So that is the match here. Auto regression model is basically the given observation on at a given point in time is correlated with the observation set a few past values so that is how the auto regression model works and spectral decomposition which we covered it is basically the fourier transform method so it is to uh investigate which are the primary frequency components in a time series and there is no parameter involved here, unlike the others. So that I hope this was easy for most of you. Any questions on this question? Or the answer? Okay, I'll move on. Yes. Okay. The second one. This is basically a most general time series. We are seeing not only a trend, we are also seeing seasonal behavior. So rather than saying, I mean, in this choice, we know that deep learning methods will work because it is very generic. Profit also is fairly generic. I have explained it can bring in season explained it it can bring in seasonalities it can bring in multiple trends so profit works triple exponential smoothing works because it is it is meant for both seasonality and trends whereas single exponential smoothing and double exponential smoothing will not work single exponential smoothing will not even be able to take care of trends double exponential smoothing will not work. Single exponential smoothing will not even be able to take care of trends. Double exponential smoothing will not be able to take care of seasonality. So these two are the ones which are not checked. All of this can be used to model this time series. Chander, while we are doing it, I'll give you some feedback. I'll tell you the questions that people did poorly in so you can uh but uh unfortunately i have to click on it to see it so i'm clicking on it and i'll tell you uh question number oh goodness question number seven okay why don't you continue i still need to figure out how to okay the exact questions questions. One question people got 22% of the people got it right. Another one only 40% of the people got it right. Okay. So are they one of the first or second? I hope not because they are. So the order I can't see your order is different from other people's. So can we see it on your screen then I will be able to. It's a violet people's. So can we see it on your screen then? I will be able to. It's a valid people's privacy. OK, because then that's course. So I'll tell you which ones that people got really wrong. This is a question. Number seven, the moving average select one of those expressions, the equation. OK, got it. This one in the moving average model. That is true. Yeah. This one in the moving average model that is true yeah this one was the performance was terrible so we need to discuss this more okay so i'll come to it i'm almost there so the third question um the seasonal arima model it turns out that the best model arises when l is equal to five this is a very straightforward question i mean if you know the definition of the pql and the capital p capital q capital d if you know that you know straight away that l equal to five means seasonality of five because that is what it comes almost from the definition of the arima model so i i think uh do you know the percentage of people who got this right? Will you be able to tell? No, unfortunately it doesn't. Okay, fine. So this moving average model, the reason I asked this question is because moving average can tend to be confused with the, there is a concept of moving average in the single exponential smoothing in all the exponential smoothing models there the moving average is having a different meaning than the meaning in a moving average model in a moving average model we explicitly write the x of n in terms of q past i mean q is some number some past observations i mean this is the what i explained in during the class when i talked about an analogy where i said the marks obtained today versus the effort put in maybe one week ago two weeks ago three weeks ago so you have let us say those are the effort put in at different points in time and you are getting a certain marks today so how they are correlated with a few observations from the past which are as far as we are concerned they are random observations i mean those are n the q past random observations they contribute to the uh current uh actual time series value okay so this is different from auto regression in auto regression the current time series value has dependence on past time series values so that is what auto regression is whereas here we are saying that the current value depends on some other terms which as far as we are concerned are like some following some normal distribution or some other particular distribution so this is the answer for it any because a lot of people got it wrong. Is there anything I need to explain to mention why these are not the correct answer? I mean, these other answers, they are giving a moving average, but they are not talking of the moving average model. So I deliberately asked this question because there is a confusion when we talk of moving average model versus what a moving average means should I go on yes if you have questions please do speak up okay as if you said one more question there was a this one the score was 33%. 33% of the people got it right. For this one, the triple exponential smoothing, this one? Yes. Okay. So this one, actually, during the lecture, maybe it was not covered in full detail, but if you go... I mentioned that we have the seasonal index in triple exponential smoothing we we model not just the trend and I mean we we have a smoothing single exponential smoothing covers only the smoothing of the series and then double exponential smoothing covers the smoothing of the trends and in triple exponential smoothing we do a smoothing of the smoothing of the trends and in triple exponential smoothing we do a smoothing of the seasonal indices so the fact that you have 0.85 0.9 and 0.95 means that these are all values which are less than one now and the factor seasonality is four if seasonality is four we know that the sum of all the seasonalities has to be really, I mean, the average of all the four seasonalities has to be one. The seasonal index is something which is greater than or less than one. If you're averaging the seasonal index across all the seasonal intervals, it has to be one. That is the meaning of seasonal index. So if you have one, two, and three being 0.85, 0.9, and 0.95, for the fourth seasonal index, let us assume it is some value X. If you add all of them, it has to be equal to four because the average of them has to be 1.2. Okay. This follows almost from the definition of seasonal index. Seasonal index is how much it is greater than or less than the overall average for the entire season. So the overall average for the entire season has to be one for the seasonal indices. So that is the way you arrive at 1.2. Okay. This one, alpha, beta, and gamma are the parameters which contribute to smoothing. So if you remember the formula, we had the alpha was what multiplied the most recent term and one minus alpha is what multiplied the previous uh term similarly with beta the beta multiplied the most recent and one minus beta the previous and so if you want to have significant contribution from past values one minus alpha one minus beta and one minus gamma have to be significant which means you need to have something which is close to zero so that one minus alpha is close to close to one okay so this is this is the argument and of course it has to be positive because all these parameters are positive terms in the smoothing models. OK, this was another question. Question seven. OK. Thirty three. Thirty three percent of the people got it. Most got it wrong most got it wrong so here i mean the it is more or less if you look at what rnn is there are rnn we always have the hidden state i mean here i have taken the most basic i have not even taken lstm or gru so in the most basic rnn you have a hidden state which depends on the input and an output which depends on the hidden state one second I think one of you need to mute your child if you are not uh it seems to be you could you please mute yourself yeah sorry yeah okay so here the key one of the key things is i have mentioned that we want to capture both the arriving and the departing passengers which means our input is really having a dimensionality of two because we are not only capturing only the total number of passengers we need to have the x a and x d the x has x is basically a two-dimensional space each at each point in time we have both the arriving and departing and of course we are we are also trying to figure out that the time series basically consists of a two-dimensional vector of values so that is the reason why it is 2 cross 100 for input 200 and 100 cross 2 for hidden to output this 3652 is really given just to confuse it is there is this is this doesn't matter as far as the dimensionality is concerned because the greater the number of intervals it will help in building the model but the weight matrix really doesn't depend on the total number of observations that we are looking at so rnn of course the whole point of using rnn is to make sure that the same weight matrix can be propagated back in time so even if even if instead of 10 years it had been 20 years that will not affect the dimensionality of the weight matrix so these two are obviously wrong because there is no connection of three six five two with the weight matrix the question is between one or two the reason it is two and not one is because we have two features in each of the input variables as well as the output which is of course the same time series. Chander, how did the 100 by 100 come up? Like what was the intuition for choosing 100 oh okay 100 uh did i mean okay i i have not mentioned it um i should have mentioned sorry that was a mistake i wanted to say that it's a hundred dimensional uh hidden space vector but actually it is the same in everyone so yes it was the question was incomplete i should have mentioned that i am using a 100 dimensional hidden feature space which is not explicitly mentioned here it should have been mentioned in fact i thought i have mentioned it obviously i have not uh but all of them have the same 100 yeah so but still i'm looking at it the other way right when we're designing the network still i'm looking at it the other way right when we're designing the network yes why would we choose 100 like what is the problem characteristic that drives the choice of that parameter no no it was it is just a random choice here in this case yeah it is not that it has to be 100 i should have mentioned i'm that we are using a hundred dimensional uh hidden feature space i should have mentioned it explicitly it is not necessary that it has to be 100 for every rn mentioned i'm that we are using a hundred dimensional uh hidden feature space i should have mentioned it explicitly it is not necessary that it has to be 100 for every rnn it's not true okay so a typical choice would be somewhere in the i would assume some 32 64 something should be okay right i think i have seen examples of 100 uh in the notebooks in fact one of the notebooks which i also went through it was using a hundred dimensional uh hidden vector dimensionality okay okay so yeah we we can use uh i i don't know if there is any reason to use one versus the other okay so you go by trial and error in terms of yes smaller is better but if that's not working go for higher yes yes yeah yeah so yeah this question is uh the way it is written it is incomplete it should have been mentioned the dimensionality of the hidden vector space should have been mentioned the dimensionality of the hidden vector space this one is the next we are going to the next one the here the main thing to remember is it's a real time series because it's a real time series and this has lots of complex numbers you need to make sure that even though you have complex numbers here the what comes out is a real series and if you do that you will realize that it has to be the a k is equal to a star n minus k because we already covered it in the during the class this this exponential has a periodicity at when when you go to when n becomes equal to capital n it actually becomes one okay so whatever is the value e power i 2 pi k n by n it will actually be the same as e power i 2 pi n minus i mean the the here this k could have been replaced by n minus k and it would be the same here this k could have been replaced by n minus k and it would be the same okay um sorry i shouldn't i thought the answer would have been the second one a of k equal to a of n minus k how did it become a of k equal to a into n minus k a not a to a star a star this is a complex conjugate this is a complex conjugate a of k is a star of n minus k because uh if if we expand it out whatever we have e a of k e to the power of i 2 pi k n by n and let us write the other term which is a of n minus k i mean this is a sum from k equal to 0 to n minus 1 right so this k if you see it will have all the terms from k equal to 0 to n minus 1 now whatever is at n minus k there will be a the n minus k is actually the same as e power uh minus you can get rid of the n it would just be e power i2 pi minus k n by n because at um n n itself it's periodic it's periodic with capital n right so and you know that e power minus i2 pi k is equal to the complex conjugate of e power plus 2 pi i k so in order to have a real okay so in order to have a real value coming out from the two contributions a of k and a of n minus k a of n minus k should have been the complex conjugate only then when you add up the two terms you'll end up getting a real value okay got it yeah thank you okay so actually this comes by if you write you expand it out expand out and you collect the terms of whatever happens at k and n minus k you will realize that the only way you can get a real time series is by having a of k equal to the complex conjugate i didn't cover this in the class but this in any textbook on fourier transforms in discrete fourier transforms this will be mentioned and if you go through the theory you will realize that for a real time series you need to have this okay yep got it thank you yeah and this again this is another coming straight forward from the definition of the pq d capital p capital q capital d i mean the what what the D in PQD in ARIMA model refers to the differencing. How many differences we need to do in order to bring in stationarity. So if you have to bring in three differences to bring in stationarity, it means that you need to have a cubic trend. Because if you had to do one difference to bring in stationarity it means that it was linear it was a linear growth if you had to bring in two differences it means the difference itself was growing it means that it was a quadratic growth if the diff if you had to do three differences to bring in stationarity it means it was a cubic this part is clear any questions on this okay okay so this was the ninth question and the last one um the total of all weights has to be one uh this this is true in any um exponential model or any any other model also It is true that the total of weights have to be when you can even do an actual calculation, if you look at one of those, let us say we are only focusing on the single exponential smoothing where you have alpha multiplying the first term and one minus alpha the previous terms, you can actually expand out that one minus alpha the previous terms you can actually expand out that one minus alpha itself can be expanded as i mean each of the previous terms will have again an alpha and a one minus alpha if you if you expand out all the weights of all the past terms though there will be infinitely many you will see that they will all add up to one so we can either see it explicitly but even if you don't see it explicitly the fact that weight of all in any averaging the all the sum of all weights has to be one okay so this is i think there were only 10 questions ask if any other questions where there were. I know those were three questions people underperformed. So you explain that. So which was the third question? Two I knew. One was the this this hundred by hundred question. What was the triple exponential? Triple exponential. Like you said, those three indices 0.8 okay 90 and 0.95 plus the fourth one yes equal four yes okay then the answer would be 1.3 no no it's off No. No, it's off. That needs to be 1.3, Chandu. It has to be 1.3. Sorry, should have been 1.3. Yeah, the average has to be one of all three. Yes, it should have been 1.3 mistake good good good catch sorry nice guys thanks gender any other the third question you these were two questions the third one the other one was right above it in the formula ones okay this one okay so uh should i uh put a correction here is there a way to correct it as if saying that this should be 1.3 let me do that so that people who want to review it later. Yeah. No, we can put the correction. I'll have to edit it. So there are a couple of corrections. Wherever you notice, you let me know. So this was one issue. And another was the fact that I didn't explicitly say that it should have been 100 dimensional. Yeah. So send me the revised questions. Yeah, I will do that. Nice, guys. any more questions before we close the quiz review and move on to the next.

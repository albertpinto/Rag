 Alright guys. So, last time we learned that the importance of future is in the model. It's not as easy as you may have guessed. First of all, given the very complex model narrative which is awaited as a black box. How would you know what is the importance of the future? You can have the notion, a very defined notion of future importance, only at some region of the future space. The future importance differs from region to region, isn't it? So for example, the example I used was a sale of ice cream on the beach. When you are very far from the beach, then, and suppose the two predictors are at least proximity to the beach and quality of your ice cream, then arguably a sale of ice cream, how much ice cream you sell, is far more dependent upon proximity to the beach. If your mind is away from the beach, you can go to the nowhere you exist. It's a much more important feature. You'll get much more bang for the buck if you move closer to the beach. On the other hand, if you are moving let's say 30 feet from the beach, going literally another 10 feet towards the water, it's probably not going to help you much. But improving the quality will have a bigger impact. So therefore, in that region of the beach's space, the more important, the dominant feature would be the quality of life. And so from that we realize that picture importance is directly, is sort of a local phenomenon. It's not a global phenomenon. It's a global phenomenon. Now, thinking that global, if you have aggregated, if you have aver it across all points in the future space, you do get an average sense of future importance. But even when you get that, you have to be aware that there may be some character which doesn't usually matter, but will matter a lot in some specific region of the future space. But because that specific region of the future space is small, it's overwhelmingly suppressed compared to other predictors. So don't usually, if you are given a choice, try to ask, like, try to contextualize it. If somebody says, what is that future importance? You can give that answer, but attach the caveat that it's a very, a sort of a broad story. It misses the fine nuances. To get a much better picture, you ask for a given prediction that we made, given input data, when we made the prediction, what factor was very good? It was much more relevant. but quite a bit related to the gradient. If you make a local model, a very local model, you can look at the gradients of the function. You can model it as a function, a linear function, a simple function, and you can look at its gradient at that point. So it will give you a sense of the . It's quite a bit of that. There's certain contacts to that, the cardinals really are sometimes you know, multiple media, you know, these things can come in. But generally, when you have created a black box model which is quite sophisticated, you don't suffer from those things, for example. So we need to get that working in the way of market. We need to regularize, regularization of market. We need to regularize, regularization, so on and so forth. You go to regularize it, and it makes terrible difference. Some people do that. Even locally, you should raise it. It's much more convenient. And so, what do you like to do? Local, you can make very simple models, and from those simple models, you can derive the future and the modern studies. That is, look. When you look locally, overall, model, there are multiple apertures. One of the apertures that we talked about is that you can take a highly complicated model, a very complicated model like this, and in this model, suppose it's a very complicated model, a slower graph. You can approximate the model itself with another machine learning model. How would you do that? In the feature space, take some random points, random straightening of points, look at the predictions that it makes on those random straightening of points, and then try to fit a model onto that relatively sparse sampling of points, not very spot sampling, but representative sampling of points, enough points, that using a simpler model, using quite a few, you could use a decision tree, so the example is tree-pan, you could use a linear, any other model, simple model, but that is interpredable. And then you can do, we are going to use this model for prediction, and we are going to use this model for explaining. When you do that, remember that it's an approximation. You are still missing onto the nuances. You are still missing onto the nuances. But it is very, very important to get a good interpretability to the models because interpretability helps you discover underlying biases. When a model tends to have bias, unexpected bias, invariably that bias is coming from either the lack of school or learning, which can be a busy effect. Much more seriously, it is coming from bias in data. Bias in data has profound implications. It leads to social error. It leads to people losing their jobs, unfortunately it leads to investors. It leads to some terrible consequences. Therefore, as machine learning experts, it is our duty, always, to be on the guard for bias. Bias is the one thing that can make, amongst the many things, it is one of the biggest things that can make machine learning from a tool for the good, from a tool for the good, to a tool for the good. You can, in the hands of the human, you can justify just about anything. And there's a lot of evidence there that is being misused. So, you have interpretation, you have a sense of all that. You persistently look for biases in your mind. It is simple modeling in the spirit. It is one thing you must do. You may extremely know that your mind is having to be used. How do you look at it? You know, back into decisions. Why do you I think the decision is, like TV decisions, very serious decisions in the other people's lives. It is a modern reality that we've got certain degree of individuality and also to make sure that as far as possible, there is no bias. You should be able to explain what you are predicting. That is a great advantage. So we can approximate it with a simple model, or we can do partial dependency bias. You realize that if I get two predictors in that target, I can make three dimensions. Three dimensions is as far as you can go. We can make two dimensions that only one predictor can do. And what we do is we marginalize the rest of the predictor. We talked about that, we're taking random variables. It's what we're doing with Ropin, with Nikoli, we do that. And so we can make partial dependency plots. Partial dependency plots are what suggest that you must always do it. Now, we realize that when we talk about normal things like regression and classification, in your earlier workshops, we were, how do you do all these things? It was much more important to lay the foundations, get you strong with your basics. But as we go along, we realize that a careful scientist, a careful data scientist, will do this as a matter of necessity. Very important. You look at the data, you look at missing values, you look at the imputed data values, you visualize that. You do all of that, but you're finding the data before you enter into modeling. But once you do modeling, you start getting the objectives. And your body diagnostics begins to work well. What body diagnostics can I say? There's one library that I've been meaning to recommend to you guys. So today, do please use it. Yellowback by Kinsley. It's a good way to visualize your engaging in the experience of who you are as a person. Just one of the points, simply nicer, more beautiful things. Anyway, moving along, once you build a model and you convince yourself that the diagnostics are good, what do you do? I told you that you must visualize its predictions on the feature space. Visualize the model's predictions. The model's predictions in the feature space obviously are in two dimensions, it's possible. In higher dimensions it becomes problematic. So what do you do? Make partial recognition plans. So what do you do? You partially use your plants. Search for internet, look at the internet, use another model, another machine learning model that learns from the predictions of the main model. So it's very interesting. You do machine learning effectively on machine learning. You do that. And then you try to visualize that similar model. You can do that. So you get an approximation at least, a good sense of approximation, of what the very, very complicated black boxes do. You do that, and then obviously the one gold standard I mentioned is, when you're talking about a feature importance, use the word about shaping. Shaping is sort of the word standard in this. You shape it, and you look at the pattern. It emphasizes that pattern. You notice that the picture you have is locally, in regions of the teacher space, you can pick two predictors, and it will show you how the future is valued in this area. It's very interesting. I would highly suggest that no notebook should be complete ever as you move on from there, without good post hoc interpretability analysis. You must do that class, you must do that. But there is one thing I would like to see, you go now to a course of a very interesting program like this. Half, don't just build a model, say look at my r square, it's so lovely. A mean square error is so low, my accuracy is so high. It's half, doesn't it? But if you can't explain what it is, you're more likely to have your question. You must have been able to build it into your mind. You must have been able to build it into your mind. Now, that was the summary of the answer. How many of you went ahead and did all the labs completed? That was the... David, Dave, Shaft, and so forth. Only one person. How about you? Did you guys do like part 3 exercises in part 3, article part 3? How many of you did it? Most of you did it. Most of you did it. Those of you who did not do it, shame, you must go and have a look. It seems like that. But it is a gem. It is a gem. See, when you write a novel, you have a visual need. Yeah, see, it's like a pyramid. And it's a very super pyramid. The pyramid is like this. 99% of the people, if we have to, we have to run up the main notebooks. By now you should be able to go to a lot of the notebooks that you see on the ground. But you should already feel that you can write a notebook better than at least a few persons at a time. How many of you feel that? If you had a notebook with all the analysis probably done that you're going through, you would already be in the top 10% or top 10% within the 24-25 years. I think the future will give tremendous importance to the internet. Part of the reason is that we're going to retire the internet. Companies in this domain have actually been able to work for creating that box models. Their idea was completely unbiased because it was the neural network and yet you could demonstrate that it was biased that it was biased against the US political process based on the concept of the trade so just because you need a sophisticated model doesn't mean that it's full of bias and it's the law that has to be enforced. So you have to. It's not just a model in question. It is the law of the land. To ensure that there is no bias in your model, before it can be used. Otherwise it's a direct violation of the law. There are many, many areas that the Govinda complies and the directive includes. There are many, many areas that are governed by compliance and regulated rules. Obviously, the labor laws and things like that, the employment system, it is a law. It's not just a law. So you have to do that. So a good move would be to always contain all of these in practice. So it makes us a way of what we did the last time. Now, I would like to take any questions from last time. How many of you write your comic newspaper? What is your newspaper? So guys, whenever you write a new book, when you go to a draft interview, you will often surprise even your written readers by the things that they don't know. It's always a pleasure to be with you. Why is it that you have that experience? I'm doing the shaft with precision trees did not work? Between the model and the model. The service among the of the subject. No, it has a black box in it. What it does is it's not a . It's a model of specific optimizations. And then it gives you a model that is not . No, just a . No, it think you can understand that because I do like to support the person. I don't need any other support. I don't need to do that for my society. I don't need to do that for you. I do need your support. Because I do need your support. As a guy, I support you on this. So I do need your support. I don't need your support. I don't need your support. I don't need your support. I don't need your support . access to it. So I'll put it from there. Is it a feature? It's a feature. And then the other question is, are you looking at a smaller number of feature sets, how far down do you go with the staff analysis? We tend to sit on the, generally, you can see Shepard's case. So then we use different models, and the first couple seem to be consistent between models, but then there's a good answer for you for, say, an MS7 member, some future data set. for say an MS7 or some future data set. It all starts moving around in different models for a first couple of years. That speaks to the fact that the typical uses of . See, the problem is that there are different ways of that. If you look at the hood one, the military sector, the military sector, the power sector. You first get the power sector, and you build a model on each of the power sectors, or features. Power sector means you take another sector, you take one feature at a time, then you take two features at a time, you take three features at a time, four features at a time, and so forth. You build the RQs, R7, R6, R7. So once you get the progress set, and you're doing models across 10, now you look at the margin and the difference, which is what you'll be doing. Yeah, so the first couple features is just in between 7 and 8. I'm not going to pretend. And when you start getting down to 3 to 5, 6, they're different in different models. When you start getting down to three or five, six, they're different in different levels. But I'm curious, are you curious too, when you have money in your hands, do you know that most of it, do you know that there is this un-different, independent, like the, you know, the original invention of the United States, . The average of all situations in all markets is the same. We don't look at the level of individualism in markets. We shouldn't. It is Shetty doing his job. The fact that he is showing you in general, it is happening in a certain way. Remember, it is not putting too much attention to it. It is just bringing to your attention the fact that when these differences exist, it probably means that there is a lot of interoperability in the overall market. And this shows that when you have situations like that, Look at the DAV price, it's a very big off-price price. But overall the shaping value that comes out in the power set itself is the ultimate feature of the price. That's a global feature of the price. So, in terms of the energy, we can all be a little bit confused about how this is going to go, how we can do it, and how we can do it. this is going to be a big factor. So, the problem is solved by a study done in India, and they say that they don't mind the use of the utility and the solution. And number of people interested in the idea is a scientific answer to that. So, let us say that you have suddenly . Suppose you have suddenly . If you got away with a pretty good result with just linear regression, your job is done. It is inherently expeditory. If you got away with just a decision tree, I mean, you're pretty much done. You can show the decision, even there or somewhere, you argue that it still needs to do a change. A faster change, it will get there by each and every day. But otherwise, you have a model. All you have is a model, anything beyond that. You have a model which you can't describe. And all you do is, for example, or support vector machine on your method. That's one of the many ideas. Now the problem is, what is the way you make this model? It's idea. It's miraculous. And that, by the way, is the popular perception about the earth. They look at it as though it's a miracle. And the world is always, unexplored in all of this, always in both awe and fear. So the question is, what are we doing with this model? Not just make accurate predictions. We need to explain this model. We need to shed light on this model. Why? Because every customer model is a question of trust. Especially when some important decisions are made. Every customer model is a question of trust. So we have to really start need this model to explain this. So that was the subject of it. So whatever model you build, unless it's a self-reliable model, it needs to be explained. And whatever you're doing last time, there's a journey of time to also do the same thing. You visualize the data using 3D drawings, you make a simpler model that explains it that is explainable. You use shape, the shaping values. These are all ways of explaining the model. . But if you think that you are resilient to modern times of the day, you don't need that. What I am saying is, you need to be resilient. The reason is that you learn decision-making, if it gives you really poor prediction compared to what you learn, then that is not winning, that you are not matched. So what you have to do is something different. You make the data, then you make a decision tree on the new learning situation. So we are not trying to fit our decision tree to the original data. We are not competing with the new learning. We are using the decision tree or any other central model to explain what the new method is. The pixel is built upon, is learning from the predictions of the first idea. They are not in each other. So can we use the feature in models and then go back and create the model? Yeah, of course, it's a problem. You do have a problem. It's a problem. But suppose consistently you find that locally and globally some teacher doesn't seem to know. It's a question, can I use that for reducing the number of teachers, reducing the number of teachers? So see, machine learning is not a reasonable process. It is a scientific process. So when you enter to a building, where you build a problem, when you actually work in the industry, typically one team will be treating 100 from the one problem. Pretty much for 4 or five years, six people say, I've got a life of four or five years and I'm not going to be able to meet you. And this very common, odd sorts of matters that people are doing, they're trying, they're doing the production, and that's what they do. Sometimes, sometimes, without getting out of the way, sometimes you are caught up and you're really, Kadang-kadang anda akan mendapat jawapan. Kadang-kadang anda akan mendapat jawapan apabila anda pergi ke negara lain, anda akan membeli aset dan sebagainya. Hanya untuk satu pulau, anda tahu anda boleh melakukannya. Pertanyaannya adalah, 6 minggu anda berada di sini, berikan 1 tahun, mereka akan melakukannya. 6 people in your team, given one year, they will do it. Now there is a fortunate cause. If it is not that valuable a team, and you need it, if you bring as much as B4IT, if you bring B4IT, then you look at the other guy and say, these guys are done, let's put them there. And let that team forever, really simple. I never said that now. But we are working on a career strategy. It's essential to them. We are giving work-structure, giving the right people some human resources. When you solve a problem, solve it the best possible way, as has been accurately studied from a business perspective, you have essentially written yourself and you've done it better than the other students. So doing a good job of issuing that has a profound impact. So if you keep on defining, so the thing is you don't solve a problem, you move on to the next and you come to the next. If you put on one problem, you spend quite a few years. You're trying everything you know to do a bit better. To do a bit more extremely well. Alright. Anything else on that before we close the chapter and move on to the next topic. We have some different, different ways of doing it. Integrated ways. Let's not cover it now. But I really want to know your thoughts about it. Because today is a day. And I want to know. Anything else, perhaps? Today is... Today is special occasions. We put it together. It is survival of access. It's going to do a good job. It's going to do a special occasion. We start with survival of access. Time is the access. It is a kind of time series data, but it needs special attention. So what is survival? We call survival rather a morbid part, because the opposite of survival is death. And this assumption has its roots, quite a bit actually, in that, but the use of it in a more general sense is in a completely, does not have to do with just the oncology department of the hospital. Because it has far wider applications. It has meaning in reliability and hearing. Because the death treatment could be your hardest case. It could be any hard case. It could be your computer case. You could talk about what kind of, what time did it take to play my computer games? What time actually my place in the town? What time did it take to physically go to the game? So, easy to understand. What is the, if you build a place for example, let's say you build this. You design it for a certain lifetime, given normal usage. If you build a plate, for example, let's say you build this. You design it for a certain lifetime, given normal usage. You have to understand that people are going to put it in a dishwasher. If they do put put in the fridge. But as a kid, you know, if you play with it, you are tasting dishes. On the other hand, you can go make dishes here in the United States, in the United States, are aware that every household has a dish for them. That's the way it's designed for everybody. But even then, a little bit of factors are involved. For example, the wine, everything is designed on a certain road, certain, these are called formulations or conditions for which it is designed on a certain load, these are called covalents or conditions for which it is designed. And if you vary the covalents, if you vary the factors, it will either fail faster, die faster, or live longer. Little weak is very rare. Suppose you take a, you just pluck apples from a tree. You know that apples are usually very too hot. So, the terminal event that you are looking for is an apple that is inedible. But, apples don't die. They just rot. At some point, it is a very human judgement. Even though it is an integral process of degradation of the other, at some point people look at it and say, I don't think that we did this. But consider that point as a point of view. Essentially, it's the death of the other. So now, that includes what we're going to be taking as nothing but furniture. So it is a valid question, the regular, how long will this apple last? So imagine that you are a small farmer in a village. You just left a lot of apples from your tree. And obviously you're not going to eat them all, you're not sharing the food. And so what do you do? You want to go sell those apples. Here comes a merchant and he says that I'll give you a dollar a hundred. Or a dollar for a dozen apples. You realize that the person is probably under-branding the artist, giving that money. Because he is likely to go sell it for a much higher price. But sometimes he doesn't have the same price. And you are like, why do you need to go sell it for a much higher price? How much is it? 5 to $6. So the farmer now says that I don't want to give it. But the farmer knows that if he goes 100 miles, there's another merchant who will buy for, let's say, $2 a dozen. If it goes 500 miles, somebody will buy it at $4 a dozen. What is that? Yes, travelling expenses are there. But there is another factor that will evolve, which is that, let's say the green cutter is a machine that has a kind of experience. So now here is the question. And if you are going by, let's say you go by, what do you go by? Amtrak or something. You send it by, what does it say? Train to Kyrgyzstan. How many hundred miles transfer to Afghanistan? Maybe in a row. It could take just two, three hours just to even buy the ticket and go. It could take a two, three hours just to even buy the ticket and go to the airport. It would take a day or so. To go another 500 miles, it would take another 200 miles, it would take, maybe two, three days. Another five days for a flight. Now the question is, suppose you started out with a thousand dozen apples. If he sells it to the guy, should he sell it to the guy right now, the local merchant, or should he sell it to the guy who will giveating process? Why should you not just load everything and go to that far-off merchant and give it to him? Time. What does time do to us? It's the range of perish. The range of the apple is finite. In the course of time, basically, he wants to move his forces, he has to ask himself, if I, like, maybe this guy is giving me only one driver. Maybe if I can go 100 miles in two days, if most of my apples would survive, let's say 10% of my apples survive, 90% survive. If I had 1,000 straw, 90% survive. If I had 1000 dozens, here I would get 1000 dollars. But if 90% survive, I would get 9900 times two, 1800, which is better, so I should therefore go there. On the other hand, to reach the person who is 500 miles away, let us say by the time you reach there, he is willing to give you $4 an apple. If only 10% of your apple survives, he is giving you a pretty good price. What's your problem? You get only $400. So you see that why understanding the survival of habits is important in business decisions. See, this happens all the time. You can buy a laptop. You can buy yourself one of those consumer grade plastic laptops. It will fit. You know that in a, what's the reason to tend to a consumer grade laptop if you use it every single day for coding and so forth. So, what we... I don't know about this. They have to say... What? What's the idea? Let's say that... One of the... What's the idea? They actually designed it last three years. Two years. Three years. If you get yourself, let's say, a slightly better laptop, let's say that you go and get yourself a Mac or something. Now what happens? You've made a lot of money. You pay a premium that's almost twice the cost. Doesn't it necessarily last you one year longer. It could last you for a median time of three years as opposed to two years. Was it worth it paying double credit? Of course not. Because you could have bought a laptop and then bought another laptop two years later. And the laptop that you were buying, since you were paying double credit, was it? It was. Yeah, that's an aesthetic expression. But if you just look at the price, the economy's perspective, two years later you get a laptop, which even is a cheap laptop, will give the hell out of this two-year-old man. Because they come home. So you have to then make a decision which one to buy. Then you can go and make yourself an absolute gorilla, like an alien, which prices itself at 6,000, 5,000, 6,000 dollars. Now, how long does that after pass? Mine is already eight years old and gone. The thing is, it will be 5,000 dollars. It's been 8 years since I've been here. The thing is, we are living in a world of art. And it's made out of sheer pigments. So it has a little bit of a taste of inside the box. Or you can just win an argument in a meeting room. So then the price starts at $10,000. You don't need to win an argument in a meeting room. So, but then the price starts at like $6,000. Is this a Microsoft? Where chairs go? Yes, chairs go up there. It's like that. So you see, guys, that survival of things is important. When you take a transit example, you run a question to an IP, you can take a small airplane and you can do a very long distance flight. Presumably you can boost up the fuel and things like that. You can keep on stopping and doing good. dan membuat peralatan dan membuat peralatan. Tidak. Tetapi anda boleh terus berhenti dan membuat peralatan. Tetapi adakah anda berani untuk berjumpa dengan satu-satunya perkara yang tidak berguna dan datang ke sini sepanjang masa? Kenapa anda tidak mengambil kereta, kenapa anda tidak mengambil kereta besar ini di mana ada kereta besar ini? Saya ingin menjelaskan kepada anda. . The modern commercial jet lander, especially with trans-continental, you know who is the savior of the Vietnam industry? What's the pedagogy about? They lose one passenger for 60 million passengers. One in 60 million. So your chances of an are one in 16. Which is why whenever you take a flight, you're not so worried about reaching the other end. You're instinctively going to your family. I'll be there shortly. But most of your worry is that my legs will be cramped, will the food be good, will I get a window seat, things like that. The reason for that is you have internalized a plan that is tremendously complicated and cheery that you're working on. None of the things that you're trying to do, None of it means to pray. Then there's giant heart, then there's giant mind. Even the sort of things I can imagine, like if your coffee, warmer, breaks down, it's not a safety issue. You really need to have it in safety. That assurance comes deeply down when you have a smartphone. So everyone's doing that. Never lie to their friend who has not done at least 10,000 hours of work. Why is that? In your degree, the likelihood of taking a flight to success is relatively low. Hazard. So let's introduce the concept of the hazard. The hazard, which is the instant, the risk. Like, you will fail now. Not having failed for the last 500 hours of training, now you'll fail. And you realize that hazard is very interesting as a concept in probability. We talked about probability density, the instantaneous probability of something happening, which is the same sort of proportion. Let me give you a reflection simple example. Suppose you have 100 kids. Some logger, I mean, company comes and they start cutting their tree. Let's say that they are still getting the treatment. So first they cut 100 trees. For A1, x is equal to 1. You can mark it as t. t is equal to 1. And t is equal to 300. t is equal to 300. And t is equal to 300 and t is equal to 4 and t is equal to 5, there is not much left, so whatever means are 3 and how many days are needed actually and in 5 days they are done, all the trees are done. So what is the probability on a given day that a tree will be done? On the first day, so how many trees are there? Thousand. So if I divide it by thousand, the sum is... So I can write probability one of a tree being chopped in, hundred trees are going to be chocolate. What's the probability? 1 over 10, 3 over 10, 3.5 over 10, 3.5 over 10. Even, you know, right? In the form of a T-O-9-1-2 Yeah, so that is a bit there's a little bit and I'm coming to that in my second So, ten. This is sort of the tapush. This is the raw probability. Somehow, magically, if you would jump to the third wave, time travel to the third wave the probability of being axed is this. Because you haven't gone through the first two days. And 3 over, 0.5 over. Now, do this. This is the way. If this axis was not time, if it was something else. So suppose this was a position, x. These were locations. This is San Francisco, Fremont, San Jose, Cupertino, or something. These were not these. Then these values will be independent of each other. And you can talk about the probability density. In the continuous limit, you could talk about the probability. Here it is a probability of mass function. Probability here is this, here is this, and so on. So, sort of like that, some other way of doing it. But time is special. What happens to time? You cannot jump here without going through this. And as somebody pointed out, here, I should not make it as unfair to say the denominator here is 1000. The denominator here is 900 because 100 of them went away. And denominator here is even less. It is 600. So this implies the probability that it has survived so far and now it is at risk. Did you see that? It has survived. So we can talk about what is called a hazard. Hazard at a given time, T, hazard of something happening at a given time, T, is you must have survived till 19 first, isn't it? And now you get into play. And now you have the instantaneous probability of... So let me put it this way. or so let me put it this way you survive and now you get into trouble you survive till 90 and then you get into trouble yeah, that is a hazard hazard problem hazard Yeah, that is a hazard. Hazard problem. Hazard. And this is the actual... I will just write it as f the atom will be used p, because both are probabilities, just different ways of the thing. This is the instantaneous probability of this happening, is that at this moment, the tree going down, means the tree has survived till this point. Isn't it? For a tree to go down at this point, it has to have two things for that to happen. It must first have survived till now, and right now comes a guy and chops it up. The instinting is the hazard of his being taken off. So let me make it very clear. See what happens is, for people, if you just look at the proportion of deaths, so in a population, so you realize that the infant mortality is very high, so people die of the disease, in a population. So you realize that infant mortality is very high and so on and so forth. But the number of people who die at the age of 130 is very low. So would you say that the probability, I mean the absolute probability of dying at the age of 130 is very low. But yet you say that, that is a common sense, the body has degenerated. Isn't it? The actual hazard of dying is 25. You're carrying a whole bundle of illnesses by the time, by 100 or 50, 50 or larger. And given the current state of medicine, science and technology, at this moment, by the time you reach that age, you have a whole set of medical complications. Mostly, some of them. You have watched it, there are many, many things that are happening to you. So the hazard of dying is very high, of each mother. Compared to a young, healthy guy, would you agree that this person has a greater hazard of dying from all the medical complications? And yet the probability, this probability is very low. If you just look in terms of absolute numbers, it turns out that very few people died at the age of 120. Now, how do you reconcile the two? The thing is, the hazard is very high, but the chances of surviving, this is the chances of surviving till 1.30 is very low. You see that? Isn't it? It's extremely low. The sum of the density of deaths at 130 years old. You see the distinction between the two concepts. What is the new concept that leads to two independent groups? It's sort of this physical, it's like one is... It's like a global community You know, it's a good question. I think that actually the verses are true. They're related to us. And I think that we can do it. And that brings into a little bit of a just survive it and I'm just very saddled with it. And I'll tell you, there's some other subtleties of this we've got to understand. Is this a very big thing that we have in all the hypotheses that we have at 1.8, 1.8 billion? Because pernicious is a virus that we basically, and we can get rid of. But, but also that we, uh... For you to die at this point, you have to have two pernicious for you. You have to have survive, and per the definition of survival now what is that? So it is literally that. Now when you talk of survival, this is the rate of failure. So pay attention guys. Do you understand? The distinction between FPM and STP. Hazard and just the instantaneous probability. So now the question is, what is the, let's look at Fp. What is the probability that, what is the cumulative probability that you would have failed, that Apple would have perished by the 10th day? What would you do with the probability that you would have failed the first day, second day, third day, fourth day, fifth day, so forth. So what you would do is if you accumulate on the continuum, you would say that... I'm just putting in a dummy variable because I'm saying that the probability that it has failed is a integral. Basically it's a summation. It's the continuum of the summation. That it has failed at any moment before now. Suppose t is now. So the cumulative chance of it having failed is that it could have failed any one of the times before now. Does that make sense? That's it, this is simple, right? So if it has not failed, then it needs to have survived. So to not have failed is? This is a core result. These are two core results. That is very interesting. Now, looking at this integral, can you also say that if this is the integral of this, then this is the derivative of this? In other words, f-thousand f-t is equal to df dt. That could be the response. What is the difference? So what does f equal to xd for xd? Is f that ? So let's see if somebody can understand. Who would like to explain what does this equation mean? So that has to do with what we are talking about in the statement about. So let's... In that context, at least in this data? Yeah, we are still taking this failure product. We are still taking this product. But it could also be survival if the advocate for this? We are creating terminology. Survival is an accumulative thing. To have survived till now means to have avoided all the instantaneous failure probabilities before now. You know what I mean? Let me read a very real thing. Suppose there is a street, and actually, I'll tell you something that young kids do, which is quite unfortunate. In many countries, if a train goes by, young kids being young kids, especially boys, what will they do? They'll dare each other to keep running across the track when the train is coming. And now how many times they can cross? They are there each other and trying to get an accident. So what happens is that whenever you do that, what is happening? The chances of you being picked are there. The fact that you survive survive after time p, suppose we keep on doing this year after year, you know that one day you'll think you get it, you miscalculate and you go back. It is quite literally a hazardous thing to do. So, ask yourself, what is the probability that on the 100th day you will die? It depends on, first of all, you haven't survived till the 100th day. Means for 100 days you have been playing the game, now that is still a very small number. That means there is a instantaneous hazard on the 100th day. Because on the 100th day, maybe there are more things going back and forth. Maybe a big angel is there. So, on that each day, the hazard will be different. There is going to be different screens, different answers. Every reason to be like, all these are different. Some days are cloudy, some are sunny, and so on. So, each day has its own hazard. There's a big chance. So, the chance that you will die on the 100th day and on the 100th day is, first you have to survive to 99 days. And then you get the hazard on the 100th day. Does that make sense? So in general, it doesn't say that survival's characterized by survival, or the probability of survival, and how many, from a thousand, and how many more? Yes. Given that the high quality, how's it going to be doing for them? How's it going to be completely doing for them? So for example, a very simple example is, we use a hockey machine in the office. Somebody retains it at a ventilator. On very rare occasions, the coffee pot shatters and the glass can close with a rustic smell. We assume the probability is very low. Nonetheless, it is there. Suppose you define that as not actually there, but injury from a coffee-bath. I say that is more or less a steady probability. It doesn't change. But the more you stay in that environment, sooner or later it will get you there. You see that? Another way of putting it is that, you know, you enter a diamond, you go to last place. Everybody believes they are dead with it. So, what is that? You know, suppose we describe death as an event, that you lose all your money. What is the likelihood that you survive the first nine months of the year? When you start. Second game, third game, but one thing you can be sure of, sooner or later you will be out. You have survived and probably you will keep going down. Even when you are winning, you know, the other team you are very young, the longer you spend in a casino, the more likely it is that you will go inside. So survival only goes down. Survival only goes down. The future doesn't increase. The priority is survival. So far so good, right? So, obviously you always assume that hazard has a positive property. So, how many of you have played for a whole day and not lost you. You know? A whole day, I lost an extra. You lost an extra. Was it after the luxury suite? No. So that is it. Survival. So survival is basically you can take it as a box. You cannot go like, you can stay like this. You cannot go up. Ultimately, the destiny is it will be like that. In the presence of any hazard, the asymptotic limit is it will go to zero. Ultimately. Or it may not go to zero. There are situations in which people can take a certain proportion of things. So, I'll give you an example. Suppose you get a basket, a seed, such that all the small stones will fall down, but big stones cannot fall down. Now you start shaking that seed, the stone. What will happen? So, the survival, the proportion of stones that survive will keep on going down, but it will never go to zero after it's survived. It will asymptote. Isn't it? Because all the big stones will be in that way. So that's how survival works. So right, survival now, but we we describe it is not necessarily morbid. For example, you can do your validity, you can define death even as a bachelor getting married. as a bachelor getting married. And so the question is, at what age does he finally get married? So that's a positive. Or for a couple that are just married, that is a good thing. It is not yet, I am saying redefining the terminology. It could be a positive event like a childbirth. So, time to first pregnancy. Or it could be, amongst others, the duration between the first pregnancy and the second. Originally. First to second pregnancy. So don't take the word survival literally and don't take the word death literally. Because if you notice, I did not say that this function, Fp, has anything in particular to do with death. It is a probability of an event. For example, you can say that my party lord is filled with cars. Gradually people drive off in the evening. People come to work, their employees' office is filled with cars, like boom. In the evening they would go out. If you take the exit of a car as the terminal even, you can create a survival curve for the cars in the garage. Isn't it? It could. That is one thing to remember. The second thing to remember is that in such events, there is always something called censorship. Now what is censorship? In public parliaments, what is censorship? When some information is rejected from the government, usually the government has to ban it. Government books. It is very fashionable in India that any government that would come, it would ban any books that opposed it. Every government has been doing that. In the US also, I am sure that once, Catcher in the Rye was banned. knowledge that was . So sometimes, for arbitrary reason, they put books that are essential. So you can't treat them. So when they are essential, when the common populace doesn't even know those things exist. Now, in this survival analysis, a view is somewhat similar, but slightly more complete. The essential shape of information is when the inherent construction of that experiment is such that it prevents you absolutely from knowing something. So for example, suppose you look at this, you study a population of youngsters. Then your data, by definition your data was, if you just look at people at the . In this one, you just assume that most people get married by 60. But in the modern society, there is a non-security. The dude has been redefined as 60. So let's say 60. We are married by 60. So you do the study of the first marriage. So you can get a lot of data, but then there will be somebody who has reached 60 and is still a bachelor. So, what do you think? Is the time that he got mad or she You don't know. Maybe in that culture people get married. He comes from a particular island which has a special culture where people get married exactly at 60.5. You don't know. In other words, that information is sensient. You cannot say anything about it. Absolutely, with absolute certainty, you cannot say anything about it. You can sort of estimate, but you cannot be sure. Because you think data sets only of at 60 are doing strongest battles. So that is censorship of information, isn't it? Let's take airplanes. Suppose you are looking at airplanes. And airplanes, when will be the time that it will actually crash? It's very hard to tell. Because most airplanes are retired before they crash. So if you actually waited for that airplane to crash, you would probably have to wait a hundred years or more. You don't know, nobody really knows how long a health care would take if you didn't retire. So most of these high reliability devices don't fail and die. They just get retired before they die. That is high censorship of information. Isn't it? You do what that try. You have patients. Suppose you have patients and you have a drug. Let us say you are studying cancer. Some form of cancer in certain stage, once people a certain stage, suppose their life expectancy was something. I think there was this medicine, the traditional medicine which is supposed to help them. You claim that you have a better medicine. Right? How will you prove it? You say, well, I have this bad, you know, with the best medicine and see, he lived longer. Is that evidence? That's an idea? Because even if you give water, you can always find a guy who lived longer. So, how do you prove it? The way that you would have to prove it is you would have to do a study of two cohorts. One cohort of people taking traditional medicine, one cohort of people taking exactly similar cohort of people taking this medicine. And the way you do that is you take a big cohort and then you randomly assign them. You randomly assign them and make sure there's no biases as far why you do that. And then you study both of them. And what you see is how the survival curve moves. So when I now talk about that, the shape of the survival curve, how the survival curve moves, what I hope I've motivated you into an interesting problem. Reliability and giving is&E is inherently this. And the kind of mathematics and the regression, the special regression that we are going to do now, is at the heart of reliability and GD&E. That is what makes it best for the whole of the machine world. It is also at the heart of a these is the germ analysis. What do all companies selling directly to consumers feel like when their customer will go to the other guy? Isn't it? The KT players that my customer will go to, I don't know, Sprint, the Sprint players, their customer, and so on and so forth. And each of these guys feel like they're going to lose a at, somebody else. . . . It's good. And then you can actually think of the bonding and the time. Right. The only assumption is that this word precedes the . If its perspective is from which perspective you're analyzing and studying the . Exactly. Because here, this, well, that's what's going on. Like we were working with . This is a good example. This mathematics is from the perspective of one thing. If he was thinking, what are my survival chances? This is very big. But if you look at it from a good kind of perspective, it will be different. His problem space itself will be different. Yeah, his problem will be different. Given the string, it is a quite key, a lot. It's the burden that he's worried about how soon can he get it, how before the tree runs. So perspective is important. It's important. Kind of adding to that, based on the domain knowledge, we decide probably that . Oh yes, yes. You have to first ask yourself, what do you consider the burden in what you consider the burden?

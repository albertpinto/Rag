 Hello, I'm a student at the University of California, and I'm here to talk to you about the new technology that we're using to help students with disabilities. We're going to talk about the new technology that we're using to help students with disabilities. We're going to talk about the new technology that we're using to help students with disabilities. We're going to talk about the new technology that we're using to help students with disabilities. We're going to talk about the new technology that we're using to help students with disabilities. We're going All right, guys. So, all right, coming back to this. So, coming back to the matter, where are we? See, the probability, let's say let's talk about this. The probability that an apple rotted on this particular diagram is conditional on having not rotten before now, survived till now, and then rotten. The hazard of its rotten, the hazard function of its rotten. Are we together? So this is important. This is the probability. Now, given any probability density function, this is PBE, probability density function. The probability that the apple has rotten by the third day, suppose we talk about the average. It means it could have rotten the first day, plus it could have rotten the second day, plus it could have rotten the third day. You have to add all those probabilities. In the continuous case, when you look at instant probabilities, the summation becomes an integral. So you can say, if the probability of cancer genome are effectively the probability that it could decay this second. So, then you have to accumulate the probabilities of all those seconds up to the third day. And that is the total probability that it would have decayed by the third day. So, this is self-evaluating. This equation, I hope, is self-explanatory. It's a cumulative probability of failure. Now, if we teach it as a cumulative probability, we call it a failure problem. The probability of failure by time t. And so the probability of survival by time t is this. Would we agree? If I have not failed, I have succeeded. So if I in some very dangerous place and there are a bunch of fools chasing you. So I think you can take it gradually, there's a risk of it. But suppose at the end of it, 70% of the probability, cumulative probability that in three days they would have caught me. So what's the probability that you would have survived after three days? 20% that you would have missed, that's it. That's it. So this is a survival, this is the definition of survival. Survive, good. So y would not be 1 minus f2. I'm working as f2. Now the condors of this equation automatically implies this. Do you see that? It implies this. Which implies this. Which implies, because F is the converse of this, you agree. Congress, it also means Ft is equal to d. 1 minus St over d. All I did is substituted the failure is 1 minus survival and survival is 1 minus failure. So far so good guys? Obviously, this is opening self-evident. And so, we have written code is clear. What we have seen is f t. Now, what is the derivative of 1? And therefore this is equal to minus d x d z. So far so good guys? And now what was f t? f t is survival and hazard. You have survived till now and then the hazard at that particular moment. And so we come to this, the Larmor equation, and yes, at least we say, st, xt is equal to minus ds. But then you can simply write this as s prime. We have prime, we need to hope it is at a point. If I just use prime for derivative, it is a simple equation. And so we come to, oh sorry, let's have to do the numbers. And so Xt is equal to minus BsBt over s prime over s. Are we clear? Oh, yeah. This is really interesting. What would you call a power in a thing? Well, this is a W-rater. I mean, most of them. what we call how, but this is a dummy variable. I mean, most of them, but we say this to answer. But most of them, it's a dummy variable. So it's nothing magical. If you don't get all of the . Now, interestingly, this equation, dst, dp, is equal to minus st, ht, which has, it is what is called a differential equation. It's a differential equation. And the a differential equation. Are you together? And the way you look at it is, you say that, hey, when I, this equation, I can write it as one over S T, V S T V T, is equal to minus S T. And this is the basic calculations that we have done in the past. And this is the same thing as dvd. The derivative of dvd of 3 log st. Why?
